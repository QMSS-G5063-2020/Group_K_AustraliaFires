## Data Viz Wiz Random Notes

**topic** Australian Bushfires

**ideas** 

- hex map of intensity (it would be super cool to make an animated kde plot actually)
- social media or news interest over time,
- google trends by geography
- insurance/damages - how or what to quantify
- could we get animal data?
- climate: can we get temperature, humidity, precipitation?



### data set resources
- (tern)[http://www.auscover.org.au/datasets/australian-gridded-climate-data] - daily info seems to end in 2018, monthly available thru Jan 2020

- (Bureau of Meterology)[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate] - seems a bit annoying to get RAW data as you can only get 1 measurement (eg, max temp) from 1 climate station at a time, over the course of multiple screens. no source of aggregate data, which makes sense

- Same as above, click on "data services" on left menu - this seems to be something a bit easier to navigate, but the data is nested in html tables (for example)[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/202001/html/IDCJDW5020.202001.shtml]
