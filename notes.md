## Data Viz Wiz Random Notes

**topic** Australian Bushfires

**ideas** 

- hex map of intensity (it would be super cool to make an animated kde plot actually)
- social media or news interest over time,
- google trends by geography
- insurance/damages - how or what to quantify
- could we get animal data?
- climate: can we get temperature, humidity, precipitation?
