Data Viz Group Projects

Link to our website: https://lnix.shinyapps.io/data_viz_app/

Rshiny App Code folder:
- Contains all of the code necessary to reproduce the final app.
- To run, download all files, data and R scripts, then open the runApp.R script, set your working directory to the location of the app files, and use the command in the runApp.R script with the path changed to the location of the app files.
- You will need to ensure you have all of the necessary dependencies install (e.g. tidyverse, shiny, DT, etc...).
- The data contianed in the 'data' subdirectory contains only the minimal datasets needed to reproduce the app, not the full datasets initially collected and wrangled. 

Presentation folder:
- Contains an mp4 video recording our presentation
- Also contians our final project book with updates on how the project evolved and why.

Text Analysis folder: 
- Dataset uploaded (Katie)
- Python cleaning code + saved dataset (Anna)
- R cleaning code and graphs (Anna)
- Summary Rmd - the summary of the findings (Anna)

Tweets folder:
- Twitter connect code, small sample only (Anna)
- Crawled dataset, hasn't been used (Anna)

Google crawler data: 
- A Python Google crawler code (Anna)
- Dataset through this code (Anna)

Weather Data:
- Dataset obtained by the Weather Source company for academic purposes (Carissa)
- Note: Too large to upload even a zipped version of the original file so a subset was chosen (Carissa)
- Variables chosen based on relevance and availablity (Carissa)
- R cleaning code and graphs (Carissa)

Fires Data Folder (Louis):
- Four datasets obtained through Kaggle containing data released by NASA. 
- 'fire_nrt_V1_96617.csv' was used for the fire point data and for the final dashboard.

Census Data Shapefiles Folder (Louis):
- 'Scripts' subdirectory contains R scripts used to retrieve census data through the 'rausstats' package and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) API.
- 'erp_2018_2019_data' contains the census data retrieved using the scripts for various levels of census aggregation.
- 'shapefiles' contains the census shapefiles for vrious levels of aggregation, retrieved from the ABS website.
