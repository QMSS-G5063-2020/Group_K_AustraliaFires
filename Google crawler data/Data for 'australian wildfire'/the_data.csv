Filed under The timing and intensity of the fires were unprecedented Australia faced a devastating start to it s fire season in late 2019 and things swiftly got worse before rains helped contain many of the worst fires in February 2020 The Verge will update this page with news and analyses What s happened so far Dozens of fires erupted in New South Wales Australia prompting the government to declare a state of emergency in November 2019 Fires rapidly spread across all states to become some of the most devastating on record An area about the size of South Korea roughly 25 5 million acres has burned At least 33 people are dead including at least three volunteer firefighters and more are missing Around 3 000 homes have been destroyed or damaged As blazes intensified in the days leading up to New Year s Eve thousands of people who were forced to evacuate sought shelter on beaches across New South Wales and Victoria Summer extends from December to February in Australia with fire season typically peaking in late January or early February On January 3rd officials warned that conditions would get worse over the following few days It s going to be a blast furnace New South Wales Transport Minister Andrew Constance said to The Sydney Morning Herald By January 10th another round of massive evacuations began across the hardest hit regions of the southeast due to dangerous winds fanning the flames The fires in New South Wales the state most affected were finally declared contained on February 13th After what s been a truly devastating fire season for both fire fighters and residents who ve suffered through so much this season We can really focus on helping people rebuild New South Wales Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said in a video shared on Twitter The relief came after torrential rains marked the wettest week in the region in three decades In what has been a very traumatic exhausting and anxious bush fire season so far for the first time this season all bush and grass fires in NSW are now contained It has taken a lot of work by firefighters emergency services and communities to get to this point nswrfs pic twitter com RhqmcYhJ1j The smoke

to one estimate from the University of Sydney Around 25 000 koalas were feared dead on Kangaroo Island Eight thousand koalas a third of all the koalas in New South Wales are believed to have perished and about 30 percent of the koalas habitat has also been wiped out The devastation only adds to existing pressures on Australia s unique ecosystems The continent is home to 244 species that are not found anywhere else The region also has the highest rate of native mammals becoming extinct over the past 200 years The Department of Agriculture Water and the Environment published a list on February 11th of the 113 animal species including the platypus that most urgently need help following the fires The potential impacts on wildlife are devastating Crystal Kolden an associate professor of fire science at the University of Idaho who studied wildfires in Tasmania in 2018 tells The Verge There won t be a full accounting for how bad it actually is for years Some ecosystems like eucalyptus forests are prone to fires and will come back But Kolden points out that Australia is also home to pockets of vegetation inhabited by species that have managed to survive for millions of years These really incredible remnants of you know the era of the dinosaurs essentially are not adapted for fire and when it burns it will be gone During the Golden Globe Awards on January 5th celebrities including Joaquin Phoenix Ellen DeGeneres Patricia Arquette and Cate Blanchett shared their concern about the fires Australian native Russell Crowe skipped the awards ceremony because of the blazes his home was damaged by the fires in November but Jennifer Aniston delivered a message from him after he won Best Actor in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for TV Make no mistake The tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change based his message said What does climate change have to do with it Firestorms are not new to Australia It s typically hot and dry similar to conditions in California or the Mediterranean Eucalyptus forests in Australia have a unique relationship to fire the trees actually depend on fire to release their seeds This season s fires however are unprecedented It s a much earlier fire season and the fires have gotten very big very early Kolden tells The Verge Weather conditions feeding the fires are historic Australia suffered from its hottest day on record on December 18th reaching a national average temperature of 41 9 degrees Celsius 107 4 degrees Fahrenheit Last month was Australia s hottest December and 2019 was the country s hottest and driest year on record Extreme heat and drought create more tinder to fuel fires The heightened intensity and frequency of wildfires fall in line with scientists predictions for a warming world The reality is this is a function of climate change this extreme heat these extreme conditions that are so volatile and are producing the types of intensity and early season burning that we do not normally see in Australia Kolden says Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison is facing heat for his own inaction on climate change and defense of coal Morrison s administration faced criticism for thwarting global efforts to complete a rulebook for implementing the Paris agreement during a United Nations climate conference in Madrid in December Morrison also got backlash for taking a vacation to Hawaii which he ended up cutting short in the midst of the fires I think there is a feeling among environmental scientists and ecologists in Australia that we ve been frozen out of the debate certainly out of policymaking I think it s now time to bring the scientists back into the tent to look at what is likely to be happening over the next few decades Chris Dickman the ecologist at the University of Sydney who estimated the death toll of animals in the flames told Public Radio International s The World We re probably looking at what climate change may look like for other parts of the world in the first stages in Australia at the moment Dickman said Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Sydney Melbourne and other cities across Australia on January 10th Demonstrators called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies and action on climate change and they shut down some roads while demanding that Prime Minister Morrison leave office Big crowd at Sydney climate protest Chanting what do we want climate justice abcsydney pic twitter com AsTMTMTRT8 How are the fires being fought Australia relies heavily on volunteer firefighters especially in the rural bush where much of the fires are burning Its fire response relies more heavily on community efforts compared to places like the United States that have centralized fire management systems The current crisis has led to some policy changes As volunteers missed work to fight local blazes Morrison announced in December that they would be compensated To bolster the local forces the Australian military sent in its own aircraft and vessels and 3 000 army reservists Help is also coming from abroad the United States and Canada have sent firefighters to battle the blazes Malaysia is preparing to send help too Experts told The Verge that under the extreme conditions there was not much more that firefighters could do until there was enough rainfall to stop the blazes or the fires ran out of fuel and burned themselves out It s not humanly possible to prevent these fires or put them out Timothy Ingalsbee executive director of Firefighters United for Safety Ethics and Ecology based in Oregon tells The Verge We have put so much of our strategy for living in fire environments all on firefighters all on suppression reacting to blazes And you know now we are facing conditions given climate change in

of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra At least 33 people have been killed including four firefighters and more than 11 million hectares 110 000 sq km or 27 2 million acres of bush forest and parks across Australia has burned Sorry your browser cannot display this map If you can t see the map click here In the worst hit state New South Wales NSW fire has affected more than five million hectares destroying more than 2 000 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere More than 1 600 firefighters are currently working to slow the spread of fires and shore up containment lines the NSW Rural Fire Service says Fires have raged near the Australian capital Canberra for weeks at one stage shutting the city s airport as flames approached the perimeter On Friday the worst blaze was just south of the district of Tuggeranong a 20 minute drive south of Parliament House Fears are growing that the rising temperatures and strong winds could make the fire uncontrollable But the NSW Rural Fire Service says it expects most of the flames to spread south east The State of Emergency declared in Canberra gives extra power and resources to fire authorities allowing them to force evacuations if necessary Victoria where fires have burned 1 2 million hectares extended a state of disaster for the worst hit areas from 2 to 11 January Some blazes are still

firefighter have died as a result of the fires Two people and an estimated 25 000 koalas were killed when flames devastated Kangaroo Island in the state of South Australia on 9 January The island is renowned for its unique mix of animal species and there are fears it may never recover Experts have expressed concerns over the survival of endangered species on the island which include the dunnart a

fire is reported to have destroyed more than 80 homes in the Adelaide Hills region in late December Fires are also thought to have destroyed up to a third of the vines that provide grapes for the Adelaide Hills wine industry Canberra has seen some of the worst smoke pollution with air quality rated the third worst of all major global cities on 3 January according to Swiss based group AirVisual Satellite images from 4 January showed the spread of smoke from fires in Victoria and NSW which has affected air quality as far away as New Zealand Although Australia has always had bushfires this season has been worse than usual The amount of land affected across the country more than 10 million hectares is now comparable to England s land area of 13 million hectares Humans are sometimes to blame for starting the fires but they are also often sparked by natural causes such as lightning striking dry vegetation Once fires have started other areas are at risk with embers blown by the wind causing blazes to spread to new areas Bush fires themselves can also drive thunderstorms increasing the risk of lightning strikes and further fires The number of people killed as a result of the fires since September 2019 is higher than in recent years Australia s deadliest bushfire disaster was Black Saturday in February 2009 when some 180 people died in Victoria If there is a serious risk of fire reaching homes or properties authorities urge people to leave in good time as fire can travel fast faster than most people can run Many Australians are asking that very question but the science is complicated Scientists have long warned that a hotter drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions some for years which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow Data shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910 with most of the heating occurring since 1950 the Bureau of Meteorology says Australia broke its all time temperature record twice in December An average maximum of 40 9C was recorded on 17 December broken a day later by 41 9C both beating 2013 s record of 40 3C By the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C including Tasmania which is usually much cooler than the mainland The main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole IOD an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean cooler in the east The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years As a result there has been higher than average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south east Asia and Australia Andrew Watkins head of long range forecasts at the bureau said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record he says A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia and this means we see less rain bearing weather systems and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country And meteorologists warn that for the moment the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue ,-1

 Bushfires in Australia are a widespread and regular occurrence that have contributed significantly to shaping the nature of the continent over millions of years Eastern Australia is one of the most fire prone regions of the world and its predominant eucalyptus forests have evolved to thrive on the phenomenon of bushfire 1 However the fires can cause significant property damage and loss of both human and animal life Bushfires have killed approximately 800 people in Australia since 1851 2 and billions of animals The most destructive fires are usually preceded by extreme high temperatures low relative humidity and strong winds which combine to create ideal conditions for the rapid spread of fire 3 Severe fire storms are often named according to the day on which they peaked including the five most deadly blazes Black Saturday 2009 in Victoria 173 people killed 2000 homes lost Ash Wednesday 1983 in Victoria and South Australia 75 dead nearly 1900 homes Black Friday 1939 in Victoria 71 dead 650 houses destroyed Black Tuesday 1967 in Tasmania 62 people and almost 1300 homes and the Gippsland fires and Black Sunday of 1926 in Victoria 60 people killed over a two month period 3 Other major conflagrations include the 1851 Black Thursday bushfires the 2006 December bushfires the 1974 75 fires that affected 15 of Australia 4 and the ongoing 2019 20 bushfires 5 In January 2020 it was estimated that over 1 25 billion animals have died in the 2019 2020 Australian bushfire season 6 The gradual drying of the Australian continent over the last 15 million years has produced an ecology and environment prone to fire which has resulted in many specialised adaptations amongst flora and fauna Some of the country s flora has evolved to rely on bushfires for reproduction Aboriginal Australians used to use fire to clear grasslands for hunting and to clear tracks through dense vegetation 7 and European settlers have also had to adapt to using fire to enhance agriculture and forest management since the 19th century Fire and forest management has evolved again through the 20th and 21st centuries with the spread of national parks and nature reserves while human caused global warming is predicted to continue increasing the frequency of blazes 8 According to Tim Flannery The Future Eaters fire is one of the most important forces at work in the Australian environment Some plants have evolved a variety of mechanisms to survive or even require bushfires possessing epicormic shoots or lignotubers that sprout after a fire or developing fire resistant or fire triggered seeds or even encourage fire eucalypts contain flammable oils in the leaves as a way to eliminate competition from less fire tolerant species 9 Early European explorers of the Australian coastline noted extensive bushfire smoke Abel Janszoon Tasman s expedition saw smoke drifting over the coast of Tasmania in 1642 and noted blackened trunks and baked earth in the forests While charting the east coast in 1770 Captain Cook s crew saw autumn fires in the bush burning on most days of the voyage 10 50 51 The fires would have been caused by both natural phenomenon and human hands Aborigines in many regions set fire to grasslands in the hope of producing lusher grass to fatten kangaroos and other game and at certain times of year burned fire breaks as a precaution against bushfire 10 59 Fire stick farming was also used to facilitate hunting and to promote the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground level plants In central Australia they used fire in this way to manage their country for thousands of years 11 Flannery writes that The use of fire by Aboriginal people was so widespread and constant that virtually every early explorer in Australia makes mention of it It was Aboriginal fire that prompted James Cook to call Australia This continent of smoke However he goes on to say When control was wrested from the Aborigines and placed in the hands of Europeans disaster resulted 12 Fire suppression became the dominant paradigm in fire management leading to a significant shift away from traditional burning practices A 2001 study found that the disruption of traditional burning practices and the introduction of unrestrained logging meant that many areas of Australia were now prone to extensive wildfires especially in the dry season 13 A similar study in 2017 found that the removal of mature trees by Europeans since they began to settle in Australia may have triggered extensive shrub regeneration which presents a much greater fire fuel hazard 14 Another factor was the introduction of gamba grass imported into Queensland as a pasture grass in 1942 and planted on a large scale from 1983 This can fuel intense bushfires leading to loss of tree cover and long term environmental damage 15 16 Australia s hot arid climate and wind driven bushfires were a new and frightening phenomenon to the European settlers of the colonial era The devastating Victorian bushfires of 1851 remembered as the Black Thursday bushfires burned in a chain from Portland to Gippsland and sent smoke billowing across the Bass Strait to north west Tasmania where terrified settlers huddled around candles in their huts under a blackened afternoon sky 10 386 387 The fires covered five million hectares around one quarter of what is now the state of Victoria Portland Plenty Ranges Westernport the Wimmera and Dandenong districts were badly hit and around twelve lives were recorded lost along with one million sheep and thousands of cattle 17 New arrivals from the wetter climes of Britain and Ireland learned painful lessons in fire management and the European farmers slowly began to adapt growing green crops around their haystacks and burning fire breaks around their pastures and becoming cautious about burn offs of wheatfield stubble and ringbarked trees 10 387 But major fire events persisted including South Gippsland s 1898 Red Tuesday bushfires that burned 260 000 hectares 640 000 acres and claimed twelve lives and more than 2 000 buildings 17 Large bushfires continued throughout the 20th century With increasing population and urban spread into bushland came increasing death tolls and property damage during large fires 18 During the 1925 26 Victorian bushfire season large areas of Gippsland in Victoria caught fire leading to the Black Sunday fires on 14 February when 31 people were killed in Warburton near Melbourne These fires remain the fifth most deadly bushfires recorded with 60 people killed over two months 3 The 1939 fire season was one of the worst on record for Australia peaking with Victoria s devastating Black Friday bushfires of 13 January but enduring for the full summer with fires burning the urban fringes of Sydney Melbourne and Canberra and ash falling as far away as New Zealand 19 The Black Friday fires were the third deadliest on record with some 71 people killed and 650 houses destroyed 3 They followed years of drought and a series of extreme heatwaves that were accompanied by strong northerly winds after a very dry six months Melbourne hit 45 6 C 114 1 F and Adelaide 46 1 C 115 0 F In NSW Bourke suffered 37 consecutive days above 38 degrees and Menindee hit a record 49 7 C 121 5 F on 10 January 20 New South Wales also lost hundreds of houses thousands of stock and poultry and thousands of hectares of grazing land 21 By 16 January disastrous fires were burning in Victoria New South Wales and the ACT at the climax of a terrible heatwave Sydney was ringed to the north south and west by fires from Palm Beach and Port Hacking to the Blue Mountains Fires blazing at Castle Hill Sylvania Cronulla and French s Forest in the city 20 22 Disastrous fires were also reported at Penrose Wollongong Nowra Bathurst Ulludulla Mittagong Trunkey and Nelligen 22 Meanwhile Canberra faced the worst bushfires it had experienced with thousands of hectares burned and a 72 kilometre 45 mi fire front driven towards the city by a south westerly gale destroying pine plantations and many homesteads and threatening Mount Stromlo Observatory Government House and Black Mountain Large numbers of men were sent to stand by government buildings in the line of fire 22 The state of Victoria was hardest hit with an area of almost two million hectares burned 71 people killed and whole townships wiped out along with many sawmills and thousands of sheep cattle and horses around Black Friday Fires had been burning through December but linked up with devastating force on Friday 13 January plunging many areas of the state into midday blackness 23 The Stretton Royal Commission later wrote wrote 23 On 13 January it appeared that the whole State was alight At midday in many places it was dark as night Men carrying hurricane lamps worked to make safe their families and belongings Travellers on the highways were trapped by fires or blazing fallen trees and perished Throughout the land there was daytime darkness Steel girders and machinery were twisted by heat as if they had been of fine wire Sleepers of heavy durable timber set in the soil their upper surfaces flush with the ground were burnt through Where the fire was most intense the soil was burnt to such a depth that it may be many years before it shall have been restored The townships of Warrandyte Yarra Glen Omeo and Pomonal were badly damaged and fires burned to the urban fringe of Melbourne affecting towns including Toolangi Warburton and Thomson Valley In the Victorian Alps the towns of Bright Cudgewa and Corryong were also hit along with vast areas in the west in particular Portland the Otway Ranges and the Grampians Black Range Rubicon Acheron Noojee Tanjil Bren Hill End Woods Point Matlock Erica Omeo Toombullup and the Black Forest were also affected Huge amounts of smoke and ash were generated with reports of ash falling as far away as New Zealand 17 After the bushfires Victoria convened a Royal Commission Judge Leonard Stretton was instructed to inquire into the causes of the fires and consider the measures taken to prevent the fires and to protect life and property He made seven major recommendations to improve forest and fire management and planned burning became an official fire management practice 24 In the summer of 1967 Tasmania suffered its most destructive fire season and Australia s fourth most deadly on record A verdant spring had added higher than usual fuel to the state s forest floors and strong northerly winds and high temperatures drove at least 80 different fires across the south east burning to within 2 kilometres 1 2 mi of the centre of Hobart the state capital The infernos killed 62 people and destroyed almost 1300 homes 3 From 27 December 1993 to 16 January 1994 over 800 severe fires burned along the coastal areas of New South Wales affecting the state s most populous regions Blazes emerged from the Queensland border down the north and central coast through the Sydney basin and down the south coast to Batemans Bay The 800 000 hectare 2 000 000 acre spread of fires were generally contained within less than 100 kilometres 62 mi from the coast and many burned through rugged and largely uninhabited country in national parks or nature reserves 18 Dramatic scenes of the city of Sydney shrouded in thick bushfire smoke and bushland suburbs on fire were broadcast around the world 25 On 29 December the Dept of Bushfire Services was monitoring more than a dozen fires around the state and homes were threatened in Turramurra by a fire in the Lane Cove River reserve and a scrub fire had briefly cut off the holiday village of Bundeena in the Royal National Park south of Sydney 26 The Age reported on 7 January that one quarter of NSW was under threat in the worst fires seen in the state for nearly fifty years as hundreds of firefighters from interstate joined 4000 NSW firefighters battling blazes from Batemans Bay to Grafton Fires in the Lane Cove River area at Marsfield Turramurra West Pymble and Macquarie Park were threatening hundreds of homes and the fire in the Royal National Park raged toward Bundeena where rescue boats evacuated 3100 people caught in the path of the fire With the Prime Minister Paul Keating on leave Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe ordered 100 soldiers to join firefighting efforts and placed a further 100 on standby 27 On 8 January the Royal National Park fire swept into the southern Sydney suburbs of Como and Jannali where many homes would be destroyed along with two schools a church and a kindergarten 28 29 The Como Jannali fire burnt 476 hectares 1 180 acres and destroyed 101 houses more than half of the total homes lost in New South Wales during the January emergency period 18 Also on 8 January fires had reached to within 1 5 kilometres 0 93 mi of Gosford city centre and some 5000 people had been evacuated over that weekend with homes destroyed at Somersby and Peats Ridge 28 By 9 January more than 16 000 people were on standby for evacuation from the Lower Blue Mountains Thousands of people were sleeping on the football field at the Central Coast Leagues Club after the evacuation of Kariong Woy Woy Umina Ettalong and Brisbane Waters Much of Gosford Kariong and Somersby had been evacuated along with Terry Hill Homes at Menai Sutherland Chatswood Lindfield Turramurra Macquarie Park and Sydney s northern beaches had been lost 60 fires were burning on the north coast as firefighters battled infernos over 30 hectares 74 acres from Coffs Harbour to the Queensland border Fires were approaching towns in the Blue Mountains including Blackheath and in the Shoalhaven including Ulladulla 30 Some 20 000 firefighters were deployed against around 800 fires mainly along the coast and ranges The fires caused mass evacuations claimed four lives destroyed some 225 homes and burnt 800 000 hectares 2 000 000 acres of bushland They were met with amongst the largest firefighting efforts in Australian history A lengthy Coronial inquest followed the fires leading to the formation of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service 25 The Rural Fires Act 1997 was proclaimed on 1 September 1997 25 31 In the last ten years or so when government licenses have been granted to fire prevention programs on Aboriginal lands in northern Australia In this area Aboriginal traditions which reduce the undergrowth that can fuel bigger blazes revolve around the monsoon Land is burned patch by patch using cool fires in targeted areas during the early dry season between March and July 32 These defensive burning programs began in the 1980s and 1990s when Aboriginal groups moved back onto their native lands Since this process began destructive bushfires in northern Australia have burned 57 fewer acres in 2019 than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010 the decade before the program started 33 Oliver Costello from the national Indigenous Firesticks Alliance stated that in southern Australia Aboriginal knowledge systems of fire management are less valued than in the north In the Kimberley area the land council applies local resources and holds community fire planning meetings to ensure the correct people are doing the burning Burn lines are approved by the group but Indigenous rangers set the fires backed up by modern technology involving constant weather readings and taking into account the conditions of the day Costello pointed out that northern Australia has developed a collaborative infrastructure for cultural burning and noted that There s no investment really outside of northern Australia Indigenous fire management of any significance 32 In recent times most major bush fires have been started in remote areas by dry lightning 34 35 or by electric power lines being brought down or arcing in high winds Many fires are as a result of either deliberate arson or carelessness however these fires normally happen in readily accessible areas and are rapidly brought under control Man made events include arcing from overhead power lines arson accidental ignition in the course of agricultural clearing grinding and welding activities campfires cigarettes and dropped matches sparks from machinery and controlled burn escapes They spread based on the type and quantity of fuel that is available Fuel can include everything from trees underbrush and dry grassy fields to homes Wind supplies the fire with additional oxygen pushing the fire across the land at a faster rate Large violent wildfires can generate winds of their own called fire whirls Fire whirls are like tornadoes and result from the vortices created by the fire s heat When these vortices are tilted from horizontal to vertical this creates fire whirls These whirls have been known to hurl flaming logs and burning debris over considerable distances 36 Some reports indicate that a changing climate could also be contributing to the ferocity of the 2019 20 fires with hotter drier conditions making the country s fire season longer and much more dangerous 37 Strong winds also promote the rapid spread of fires by lifting burning embers into the air This is known as spotting and can start a new fire up to 40 kilometres 25 mi downwind from the fire front 38 In the Northern Territory fires can also be spread by black kites whistling kites and brown falcons These birds have been spotted picking up burning twigs flying to areas of unburned grass and dropping them to start new fires there This exposes their prey attempting to flee the blazes small mammals birds lizards and insects 39 Bushfires in Australia are generally described as uncontrolled non structural fires burning in a grass scrub bush or forested area The nature of the fire depends somewhat on local topography Hilly mountainous fires burn in areas which are usually densely forested The land is less accessible and not conducive to agriculture thus many of these densely forested areas have been saved from deforestation and are protected by national state and other parks The steep terrain increases the speed and intensity of a firestorm Where settlements are located in hilly or mountainous areas bushfires can pose a threat to both life and property Flat grassland fires burn along flat plains or areas of small undulation predominantly covered in grasses or scrubland These fires can move quickly fanned by high winds in flat topography and they quickly consume the small amounts of fuel vegetation available These fires pose less of a threat to settlements as they rarely reach the same intensity seen in major firestorms as the land is flat the fires are easier to map and predict and the terrain is more accessible for firefighting personnel Many regions of predominantly flat terrain in Australia have been almost completely deforested for agriculture reducing the fuel loads which would otherwise facilitate fires in these areas Australia s climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts 40 Eight of Australia s ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2005 41 A study in 2018 conducted at Melbourne University found that the major droughts of the late 20th century and early 21st century in southern Australia are likely without precedent over the past 400 years 42 Across the country the average summer temperatures have increased leading to record breaking hot weather 43 with the early summer of 2019 the hottest on record 44 2019 was also Australia s driest ever year since 1900 with rainfall 40 lower than average 45 Heatwaves and droughts dry out the undergrowth and create conditions that increase the risk of bushfires This has become worse in the last 30 years 46 Since the mid 1990s southeast Australia has experienced a 15 decline in late autumn and early winter rainfall and a 25 decline in average rainfall in April and May Rainfall for January to August 2019 was the lowest on record in the Southern Downs Queensland and Northern Tablelands New South Wales with some areas 77 below the long term average 43 In the 2000s the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC concluded that ongoing anthropogenic climate change was virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency of fires in Australia a conclusion that has been endorsed in numerous reports since 40 In November 2019 the Australian Climate Council published a report titled This is Not Normal 8 which also found the catastrophic bushfire conditions affecting NSW and Queensland in late 2019 have been aggravated by climate change 43 According to Nerilie Abram writing in Scientific American the link between the current extremes and anthropogenic climate change is scientifically indisputable 40 In 2020 an international team of scientists found the hot and dry conditions that helped drive Australia s 2019 2020 bushfire crisis would be eight times more likely to happen if the earth warms by 2C 47 Until the 2019 2020 Australian bushfire season the forests in Australia were thought to reabsorb all the carbon released in bushfires across the country This would mean the forests achieved net zero emissions However scientists now say that global warming is making bushfires burn more intensely and frequently and believe the 2019 2020 fires have already released approximately 350 million tonnes 390 million short tons of carbon dioxide as much as two thirds of Australia s average annual carbon dioxide emissions 530 million tonnes 580 million short tons in 2017 48 in just the past three months David Bowman professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the University of Tasmania warned that so much damage has been done that Australian forests may take more than 100 years to re absorb the carbon that has been released so far this fire season 41 In January 2020 the British Met Office said Australia s bushfires in 2019 2020 were expected to contribute 2 to the increase in the atmospheric concentration of major greenhouse gases which are forecast to hit 417 parts per million one of the largest annual increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide on record 49 Climate studies show that conditions which promote extreme bushfires in Australia will only get worse as more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere 45 Bushfires in Australia can occur all year round though the severity and the bushfire season varies by region 50 51 52 There is no formal definition for a single bushfire season across the whole of Australia There is no one terminology used for periods of fire activity The technical terms used for periods of fire risk and fire activity include fire weather season 53 fire danger season 53 54 bush fire danger period 55 fire danger period 56 57 fire permit period 58 restricted burning times and prohibited burning times 59 and fire season 60 The term Australian bushfire season is a colloquialism broadly defined by common usage from when the first uncontrolled fires start any time from June onwards 61 typically shortened to bushfire season and applies mainly to southern and eastern Australia 62 63 64 It can continue through to April 65 Central and northern Australia have two separately defined fire seasons 60 66 The colloqial term is typically used in conjunction with the technical terms when conveying information to the public 67 68 The Australian Bureau of Meteorology defines five fire danger seasons being times of peak bushfire activity roughly corresponding to broad bands of latitude across the Australian continent 53 including winter and spring across the most northern parts of Australia spring spring and summer summer and summer and autumn across the most southern parts of Australia Each Australian state and territory jurisdiction defines periods of peak fire risk or fire activity differently New South Wales has a default statutory bush fire danger period defined in law from 1 October to 31 March 55 The state government can then declare different start and end dates for bush fire danger periods for each local government area within the state In 2019 these started 1 August 69 Victoria declares a fire danger period for each local government area Victorian fire danger periods typically start in October and finish as late as May 56 The South Australia Government declares a fire danger season for each local government area potentially starting in October and finishing at the end of April 54 The Tasmanian Government declares fire permit period s for local government areas In 2019 this commenced 31 October 58 Western Australia requires each local government area to declare its own restricted burning times roughly aligned with spring and autumn and prohibited burning times roughly aligned with summer 70 71 59 The Northern Territory defines two broad fire seasons a northern fire season which can run from April to November and a central Australian fire season which can run from October to March 60 The Government also refers to these as fire danger periods 57 Bushfire seasons are commonly grouped into years such as 2019 2020 Australian bushfire season and typically apply to the season for southern and eastern Australia from 1 June to 31 May annually Bush fires kill animals directly and also destroy local habitats leaving the survivors vulnerable even once the fires have passed Professor Chris Dickman at Sydney University estimates that in the first three months of the 2019 2020 bushfires over 800 million animals died in NSW and more than one billion nationally 72 This figure includes mammals birds and reptiles but does not include insects bats or frogs Many of these animals were burnt to death in the fires with many others dying later due to the depletion of food and shelter resources and predation by feral cats and red foxes Dickman adds that Australia has the highest rate of species loss of any area in the world 73 with fears that some of Australia s native species like the Kangaroo Island dunnart may even become extinct because of the current fires 74 Koalas are perhaps the most vulnerable because they are slow moving In extreme fires koalas tend to climb up to the top of a tree and curl into a ball where they become trapped In January 2020 it was reported that half of the 50 000 koalas on Kangaroo Island off Australia s southern coast which are kept separate to those on the mainland as insurance for the species future are thought to have died in the previous few weeks 75 Wildlife ecologist Professor Euan Ritchie from Deakin University says that when fires have passed frogs and skinks are left vulnerable when their habitats have been destroyed Loss of habitat also affects already endangered species such as the western ground parrot the Leadbeater s possum the Mallee emu wren a bird which cannot fly very far and Gilbert s potoroo Beekeepers have also lost hives in bushfires 39 Kangaroos and wallabies can move quickly trying to escape from fires However the Guardian reported in January 2020 that dozens maybe hundreds of kangaroos perished in their droves as they tried to outrun the flames near Batlow in NSW 75 The most resilient animals are those that can burrow or fly Possums often get singed but can sometimes hide in tree hollows Wombats and snakes tend to go underground 39 Goannas can benefit from bushfires Dickman says In central Australia we ve seen goannas coming out from their burrows after a fire and picking off injured animals singed birds young birds small mammals surface dwelling lizards and snakes 39 The most devastating impact on humans is that bushfires have killed over 800 people since 1851 2 In addition to loss of life homes properties and livestock are destroyed potentially leaving people homeless traumatised and without access to electricity telecommunications and in some cases to drinking water 76 Bushfires produce particulate matter pollution airborne particles that are small enough to enter and damage human lung tissue Following the Hazelwood fire in 2014 Fay Johnston an associate professor of public health at the University of Tasmania s Menzies Institute for Medical Research says young children exposed to smoke either as infants toddlers or in the womb develop changes to their lung function She says Unborn babies exposed to the Hazelwood smoke were more likely to experience coughs or colds two to four years after the fires 77 Other studies conducted in Australia show an increase in respiratory diseases among adults stemming from air pollution caused by bushfires 78 As a result of intense smoke and air pollution stemming from the fires in January 2020 Canberra measured the worst air quality index of any major city in the world The orange tinged smoke entered homes and offices buildings across the capital making breathing outside very difficult forcing businesses and institutions to shut their doors 79 Studies show that residents of highly polluted cities also have an increased risk of heart attack stroke and diabetes Professor Jalaluddin a chief investigator with the Centre for Air Pollution Energy and Health Policy Research says There is increasing evidence around air pollution and the development of neurological conditions for example Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s 77 Prof David Bowman director of the Fire Centre Research Hub at the University of Tasmania referred to the 2019 2020 fires as absolutely transformative and unprecedented in scale and stated It s pretty much a third of the Australian population that has been impacted with prolonged episodic exposure and sometimes extreme health impacts Since September 2019 close to 3 000 firefighters have been out every day in NSW battling blazes The NSW RFS stated that close to 90 of those are unpaid volunteers 80 David McBride associate professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Otago stated They push themselves to the limit they can suffer heat stress which is a life threatening injury and end up with chronic bronchitis and asthma 81 Psychological problems following a major bushfire appear to develop when people have a chance to stop and reflect on their experience A study of 1 526 people who experienced significant losses in the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires found that after 12 months 42 met the criteria for a psychiatric problem which is double the prevalence in an unaffected community After twenty months this figure had dropped to 23 82 A typical example of how people are affected is described by the 2016 fire at Yarloop in Western Australia It virtually destroyed the town population 395 including 180 homes historic timber workshops factories an old church the old hospital shops the hotel the fire station and a part of the school Two people died Damage to infrastructure included the Samson Brook Bridge Salmon River Bridge and power infrastructure supplying thousands of homes in the area 83 Two years later people from Yarloop were still suffering from trauma distress from the fire Apart from the economic losses suffered by those who lived there the dislocation to their lives was so great that many in the community were doubtful that the town would be rebuilt 84 The WA Government subsequently spent A 64 million rebuilding the town and the surrounding communities 85 Economic damage from 2009 s Black Saturday fires the costliest in Australia s history reached an estimated A 4 4 billion Moody s Analytics says the cost of the 2019 2020 bushfires is likely to exceed even that figure and will cripple consumer confidence and harm industries such as farming and tourism 86 Medical bills from the current fires and smoke haze are expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars with one analysis suggesting disruptions caused by the fire and smoke haze could cost Sydney as much as A 50 million a day 87 The Insurance Council of Australia estimates that claims for damage from the fires would be more than A 700 million with claims expected to jump when more fire hit areas become accessible In January 2020 it was reported that the ANZ gauge of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in more than four years 76 In response to the current fires the federal government announced that compensation would be paid to volunteer firefighters military personnel would be deployed to assist and an A 2 billion bush fire recovery fund would be established New South Wales which has been hardest hit by the crisis has pledged A 1 billion focused on repairing infrastructure 88 After many major bushfires state and federal governments have initiated inquiries to see what could be done to address the problem A parliamentary report from 2010 stated that between 1939 and 2010 there have been at least 18 major bushfire inquiries including state and federal parliamentary committee inquiries COAG reports coronial inquiries and Royal Commissions 89 Another report published in 2015 stated there have been 51 inquiries into wildfires and wildfire management since 1939 The authors noted that Royal Commissions were not the most effective way to learn from past bushfire events 90 Many of the inquiries into bushfires have recommended hazard reduction burning 91 intended to reduce the available fuel and have set targets to burn a certain percentage of forest each year to reduce risk Planned burns are difficult to do safely and many of the investigations and Royal Commissions have found these targets are seldom met At the same time fire management experts disagree on how effective planned burning is 92 In January 2020 during the 2019 2020 bushfire season Prime Minister Scott Morrison raised the prospect of establishing another royal commission In an interview on ABC TV 7 30 Morrison stated that any inquiry into the crisis would need to be comprehensive and investigate climate change as well as other possible causes 93 During the fire season the Bureau of Meteorology BOM provides fire weather forecasts Fire agencies determine the appropriate Fire Danger Rating by considering the predicted weather including temperature relative humidity wind speed and dryness of vegetation These Fire Danger Ratings are a feature of weather forecasts and alert the community to the actions they should take in preparation for the day Ratings are broadcast via newspapers radio TV and the internet 94 In 2009 a standardised Fire Danger Rating FDR was adopted by all Australian states This included a whole new level catastrophic fire danger The first time this level of danger was forecast for Sydney was in November 2019 during the 2019 2020 bushfire season 95 In 2010 following a national review of the bush fire danger ratings new trigger points for each rating were introduced for grassland areas in most jurisdictions Remote monitoring of wildfires is done in Australia Geoscience Australia developed the real time Sentinel bushfire monitoring system It uses data from satellites to help fire fighting agencies assess and manage risks 96 97 98 There is also MyFireWatch which is a program based on an existing Department of Fire and Emergency Services DFES program redeveloped by Landgate and Edith Cowan University ECU for use by the general public 99 100 Besides the use of satellites Australian firefighters also make use of UAV s as a tool for combating fire 101 The Australasian Fire Authorities Council AFAC is the peak body responsible for representing fire emergency services and land management agencies in the Australasian region The Rural Fire Service RFS is a volunteer based firefighting agency and operates as part of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services 102 Fire and Rescue NSW FRNSW the Forestry Corporation of NSW FCNSW the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service RFS work together to manage and respond to fires across New South Wales The Country Fire Service is a volunteer based fire service in the state of South Australia The CFS operates as a part of the South Australian Fire and Emergency Services Commission SAFECOM In Victoria the Country Fire Authority CFA provides firefighting and other emergency services to country areas and regional townships within the state as well as large portions of the outer suburban areas and growth corridors of Melbourne not covered by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade 103 Responsibility for fire suppression and management including planned burning on public land such as State Forests and National Parks which makes up about 7 1 million hectares or about one third of the State sits with the Department of Environment Land Water and Planning DELWP The Department of Fire and Emergency Services DFES and the Department of Parks and Wildlife P W have joint responsibility for bushfire management in Western Australia 104 DFES is an umbrella organisation supporting the Fire and Rescue Service FRS Bush Fire Service BFS Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service VFRS State Emergency Service SES Volunteer Fire and Emergency Service VFES Emergency Services Cadets and the Volunteer Marine Rescue Service VMR The Tasmania Fire Service manages bushfires in Tasmania with the help of Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service and Forestry Tasmania 105 106 Local authorities provide education and information for residents in bushfire prone regions regarding the location of current fires 107 preservation of life and property 108 and when to escape by car 109 Bushfires have accounted for over 800 deaths in Australia since 1851 and in 2012 the total accumulated cost was estimated at 1 6 billion 110 In terms of monetary cost however they rate behind the damage caused by drought severe storms hail and cyclones 111 perhaps because they most commonly occur outside highly populated urban areas However the severe fires of the summer of 2019 2020 affected densely populated areas including holiday destinations leading NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons to claim it was absolutely the worst bushfire season on record

Support nonprofit journalism On the outskirts of Canberra the Orroral Valley Fire blazed on January 28 2020 New research suggests the recent record breaking heat in southeastern Australia which is linked to climate change helped increase the region s fire risk by at least 30 percent Nick D Wikimedia Commons CC BY SA 4 0 By Carolyn Gramling March 4 2020 at 12 39 pm Human caused climate change made southeastern Australia s devastating wildfires during 2019 2020 at least 30 percent more likely to occur researchers report in a new study published online March 4 A prolonged heat wave that baked the country in 2019 2020 was the primary factor raising the fire risk said climate scientist Geert Jan van Oldenborgh with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt The study also linked the extremity of that heat wave to climate change van Oldenborgh said March 3 during a news conference to explain the findings Such an intense heat wave in the region is about 10 times more likely now than it was in 1900 the study found Van Oldenborgh also noted that climate simulations tend to underestimate the severity of such heat waves suggesting that climate change may be responsible for even more of the region s high fire risk We put the lower boundary at 30 percent but it could well be much much more he said This week the southeastern Australia region was declared free of wildfires for the first time in over 240 days according to a statement March 2 by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on Twitter The fires have burned through an estimated 11 million hectares killing at least 34 people and destroying about 6 000 buildings since early July About 1 5 billion animals also died in the blazes Researchers are still tallying the damage and assessing the potential for recovery for many native plant and animal species SN 2 11 20 Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles delivered to your inbox The climate attribution study was conducted by the World Weather Attribution group an international consortium of researchers who investigate how much of a role climate change might be playing in natural disasters Given the quick turnaround time the study has not yet been peer reviewed We wanted to bring the scientific evidence forward at a time when the public is talking about the event said climate modeler Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford Then the group examined how climate change altered the Fire Weather Index an estimation of the risk of wildfires The climate simulations show that the probability of a high Fire Weather Index during the 2019 2020 season increased by at least 30 percent relative to the fire risk in 1910 That is primarily due to the increase in extreme heat the study was not able to determine the impact of climate change on extreme drought conditions which also helped fuel the blazes Researchers previously have suggested that an El Niño like atmosphere ocean weather pattern known as the Indian Ocean Dipole which was in a strong positive phase in 2019 may have played a role in exacerbating the dry conditions SN 1 9 20 Global warming may make such extreme positive phases of this pattern more common The new study confirmed that the 2019 positive phase made drought conditions more extreme but could not confirm this particular phase s relationship to climate change It is always rather difficult to attribute an individual event to climate change but this study is nicely done says Wenju Cai a climate scientist at CSIRO who is based in Melbourne Australia The link identified to climate change is reasonable if not particularly surprising he says The year 2019 was Australia s hottest and driest since modern recordkeeping began in the country in 1910 Summers Down Under also appear to be lengthening The Australia Institute a Canberra based think tank released a report March 2 that found that Australian summers during the years 1999 to 2018 lasted longer by a month on average than they did 50 years ago Temperature observations going back to 1910 show that the region s temperatures have risen by about 2 degrees Celsius on average van Oldenborgh and colleagues report The climate simulations underrepresented that warming however showing an increase of only 1 degree Celsius in that time Climate modelers previously have struggled to reconcile the disparity between recorded temperatures and simulated heat waves Simulations tend to underestimate the severity of the extreme events The team noticed a similar underestimation in its simulations of the 2019 heat waves in Europe SN 7 2 19 Conditions not generally factored into regional climate simulations such as land use changes may be responsible for the disparity Changes in vegetation cover for example can have

News Analysis What many of us have witnessed this fire season feels alive and monstrous With climate change forcing a relaxed country to stumble toward new ways of work leisure and life will politics follow Firefighters on the outskirts of Bredbo New South Wales Australia on Feb 1 Credit Supported by By Damien Cave Photographs by Matthew Abbott SYDNEY Australia In a country where there has always been more space than people where the land and wildlife are cherished like a Picasso nature is closing in Fueled by climate change and the world s refusal to address it the fires that have burned across Australia are not just destroying lives or turning forests as large as nations into ashen moonscapes They are also forcing Australians to imagine an entirely new way of life When summer is feared When air filters hum in homes that are bunkers with kids kept indoors When birdsong and the rustle of marsupials in the bush give way to an eerie smoky silence I am standing here a traveler from a new reality a burning Australia Lynette Wallworth an Australian filmmaker told a crowd of international executives and politicians in Davos Switzerland last month What was feared and what was warned is no longer in our future a topic for debate it is here We have seen she added the unfolding wings of climate change Like the fires it s a metaphor that lingers What many of us have witnessed this fire season does feel alive like a monstrous gathering force threatening to devour what we hold most dear on a continent that will grow only hotter drier and more flammable as global temperatures rise It s also a hint of what may be coming to a town city or country near you And in a land usually associated with relaxed optimism anxiety and trauma have taken hold A recent Australia Institute survey found that 57 percent of Australians have been directly affected by the bush fires or their smoke With officials in New South Wales announcing Thursday that heavy rain had helped them finally extinguish or control all the state s fires that have raged this Australian summer the country seems to be reflecting and wondering what comes next Politics have been a focal point one of frustration for most Australians The conservative government is still playing down the role of climate change despite polls showing public anger hitting feverish levels And yet what s emerging alongside public protest may prove more potent In interviews all over the fire zone since September it s been clear that Australians are reconsidering far more than energy and emissions They are stumbling toward new ways of living Housing holiday travel work leisure food and water are all being reconsidered If there s not a major shift that comes out of this we re doomed said Robyn Eckersley a political scientist at the University of Melbourne who has written extensively about environmental policy around the world It does change everything or it should Professor Eckersley is one of many for whom climate change has shifted from the distant and theoretical to the personal and emotional Before the fires peaked last month she and I had often spoken in dry terms about Australia and climate change policy This last time as she sat in a vacation home southwest of Melbourne where smoky haze closed a nearby beach she told me about a friend driving south from Brisbane by all these towns and farms he couldn t imagine bouncing back Australia she argued must accept that the most inhabited parts of the country can no longer be trusted to stay temperate and she added that means massive changes in what we do and the rhythm of our work and play More specifically she said the economy needs to change not just moving away from fossil fuels a major export but also from thirsty crops like rice and cotton Building regulations will probably stiffen too she said Already there are signs of growing interest in designs that offer protections from bush fires and regulators are looking at whether commercial properties need to be made more fireproof as well The biggest shifts however may not be structural so much as cultural Climate change threatens heavy pillars of Australian identity a life lived outdoors an international role where the country punches above its weight and an emphasis on egalitarianism that according to some historians is rooted in Australia s settlement by convicts Since the fires started tens of millions of acres have been incinerated in areas that are deeply connected to the national psyche If you re American imagine Cape Cod Michigan s Upper Peninsula the Sierra Nevadas and California s Pacific Coast all rolled into one and burned It s a place of childhood vacations and dreams as one of Australia s great novelists Thomas Keneally recently wrote For months on end driving through these areas where tourism agriculture retirement and bohemian living all meet for flat whites at the local cafe has meant checking reports for closed roads and wondering if the thick clouds of smoke in the distance mean immediate danger There s an absurdity even to the signs The ones that aren t melted warn of wet roads Just beyond them are trees black as coal and koalas and kangaroos robbed of life The fear of ferocious nature can be tough to shake Fires are still burning south and west of New South Wales and to many the recent rain near Sydney felt as biblical as the infernos the storms put out some areas got more than two feet flooding rivers and parched earth hardened by years of drought Last month in Cobargo a dairy and horse town six hours drive from Sydney I stood silently waiting for the start of an outdoor funeral for a father and son who had died in the fires a few weeks earlier When the wind kicked up everyone near me snapped their heads toward where a fire burned less than a mile away It just hasn t stopped said an older man in a cowboy hat No other sentiment has better captured Australia s mood That same day in the coastal town of Eden government officials welcomed a cruise ship declaring the area safe for tourists A week later another burst of fire turned the sky over Eden blood red forcing residents nearby to evacuate It s no wonder that all across the area known as the South Coast the streets in summer have looked closer to the quiet found in winter Perhaps some now say that s how it should be We should no longer schedule our summer holidays over the Christmas season Professor Eckersley said Maybe they should be in March or April Certainly we should rethink when and whether we go to all the places in the summer where we might be trapped she added David Bowman a climate scientist in Tasmania who wrote an article calling for the end of the summer school holiday which went viral said Australia s experience could help the world understand just how much climate change can reorder the way we live You can t pretend that this is sustainable he said If that s true you re going to have to do something different Smoke may be more of a catalyst than flame For much of the summer a fog of soot has smothered Sydney Melbourne and Canberra In Sydney alone there were 81 days of hazardous very poor or poor air quality last year more than the previous 10 years combined And until the recent rains the smell of smoke often returned Mike Cannon Brookes Australia s most famous tech billionaire called it part of a broader awakening It s bringing home the viscerality of what science and scientists have been telling us is going to happen he said There s unity in that as so many have seen climate change up close and personal But there s also inequality The air filters selling out at hardware stores last month cost close to 1 000 each In December I heard surfers in the waves at Bondi Beach deciding to get out early to avoid breathing in too much smoke and ash but farther west where working class immigrants cluster I met a bicycle delivery driver who said he could work only a couple of hours before feeling sick Mr Cannon Brookes said Australia could seize the moment and become a leader in climate innovation Ms Wallworth the filmmaker echoed that sentiment What if the country s leaders did not run from the problem of climate change but instead harnessed the country s desire to act If only our leaders would call on us and say Look this is a turning point moment for us the natural world in Australia that s our cathedral and it s burning our land and the animals we love are being killed she said If they called on us to make radical change the nation would do it In The Lucky Country the 1964 book of essays by Donald Horne that is often described as a wake up call to an unimaginative nation Australians are deemed tolerant of mediocrity but adaptable when a way is shown One afternoon I traveled to the Sutherland Shire near where Prime Minister Scott Morrison lives with Horne s comments on my mind Near a bus stop I met Bob Gallagher 71 a retired state employee with thick white hair He felt strongly that the criticism of Mr Morrison for not doing enough about climate change was unfair The first thing the government needs to do is run the economy Mr Gallagher said I just don t understand what these climate change people want I asked him to imagine a version of Ms Wallworth s dream an Australia with a prime minister who shouted to the world What we all love this unique country is being destroyed by inaction We ll punch above our weight but we can t do it alone We need your help Mr Gallagher listened without interrupting I hadn t thought of that he said I could support that

Australia is enduring a hellish fire season Here s how to help Since September at least 27 million acres of Australia have burned in one of the country s worst fire seasons on record That s an area larger than Portugal and more than 14 times the area that burned in California in 2018 the state s most destructive year for wildfires The fires have now killed at least 29 people and destroyed some 2 500 homes The destruction to the country s land and biodiversity is harder to fathom An estimated 1 25 billion animals have been lost and scientists fear long term damage to many sensitive ecosystems The severity of the widespread fires is a symptom of global warming and the blazes may even contribute to it at least in the short term Australia s bushfires have released 400 megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere according to the European Union s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Burning huge swaths of forest introduces carbon stored in biomass back into the atmosphere and that carbon will stay there essentially as long as it takes the forest to regrow Meanwhile some of the fires are under better control after some flooding rain and golf ball sized hail Melbourne was hit with a month s worth of rain in one day over the weekend But others are burning on On Wednesday a fire near the airport in the capitol Canberra forced evacuations in the city Weather conditions still favor fire in many parts of the country Parts of New South Wales is forecast to be over 100 F on Thursday In Victoria 40 mph wind gusts are expected this week and they may fuel more flames At 6 15pm there s currently 64 bush and grass fires burning across NSW 16 yet to be contained Tonight more than 1 100 personnel continue work to slow the spread of fire and strengthen containment lines ahead of deteriorating weather later this week NSWRFS pic twitter com oYYNzJFZz4 It s a disaster that s particularly ominous In a warming world extreme fire events like this one will only grow more likely to occur Here s what everyone should know about the crisis down under The fires are concentrated along Australia s southeast coast in the states of New South Wales and Victoria The southeast is the most severely affected but fires have also hit every Australian state and territory this season The fires started in various ways some by lightning some by human actions including arson However it s the climate conditions that provide ample fuel for the fires to grow and spread Before the fires ignited Australia was already enduring its hottest and driest year on record It s summertime in the southern hemisphere and the heat keeps rising On Saturday January 4 Sydney experienced its highest temperature on record So did Australia s capital Canberra And triple digit temperatures continue to bake huge swaths of the country Much of the severe heat was accompanied by brisk winds across much of Australia which exacerbates fire risks and spreads blazes The intensity and size of bushfires in some areas has led to the creation of their own weather systems the Red Cross reported on January 8 generating pyrocumulonimbus clouds trapping heat and generating strong wind and lightning strikes in turn sparking further fires High temperatures dry weather and wildfires are not unusual this time of year But the severity and continued persistence of these fiery conditions are alarming and fit the pattern of what scientists expect as the climate changes This summer s high temperatures and subsequent fires are linked to climate change which drives long term warming trends and makes these kinds of events more severe Australia is also facing a severe drought spurred by three winters in a row with very little precipitation With drought conditions there is less moisture evaporating in the heat a phenomenon that usually has a cooling effect But the country s geography is also a factor as well as the unfortunate alignment of a few short term weather patterns One sign a huge heatwave was coming was that the Indian Ocean Dipole the cycle of the temperature gradient between the eastern and western parts of the Indian Ocean was in its positive phase in 2019 That led to much less rainfall over Australia as prevailing winds pushed moisture gathering above the Indian Ocean away from the continent in the spring Related Another alarm bell was the Southern Annular Mode This describes the movement of the circular belt of wind around Antarctica as it shifts north or south It s in its negative phase right now bringing dry conditions to Australia And while Australia s annual monsoon rains in the northern part of the country packed a devastating wallop in February causing dangerous flooding in the state of Queensland they were also behind schedule this year That allowed more heat to accumulate over the central part of the country So there was lots going on in terms of natural climate variability for this season to be quite hot Perkins Kirkpatrick a senior lecturer at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales Sydney explained Wildfires are a natural part of the ecosystem in Australia Many plants and other organisms even depend on regular blazes to germinate cycle nutrients and clear decay That said the climate is getting hotter due to human activities And that extra heat makes fires more likely Australia s climate has warmed by just over 1 C since 1910 leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology s 2018 State of the Climate report This has also led to more rainfall in northern Australia but less in the southeast where most Australians live and where some of the most intense fires are burning The combination of rising heat and drier weather has turned vegetation into tinder leaving trees shrubs and grass ready to ignite near some of the most densely populated parts of the country There has been a long term increase in extreme fire weather and in the length of the fire season across large parts of Australia according to the climate report These fires may not be 100 percent attributable to climate change But you can look at them and at least see a vision of the future Scientists expect to see more extreme wildfires in Australia in the latter part of this century Australia is one of the great biodiversity hotspots in the world The island continent was isolated from the rest of the world for millions of years allowing evolution to take strange new paths and until fairly recently with little human influence Around 244 species of mammals are found only in Australia Before the fires its great diversity of life was already threatened due to invasive species habitat destruction and climate change according to Australia s science research agency CSIRO Now ecologists are fearing severe ecological consequences from so much land being burnt at once The whole concept of an ecosystem is about connectivity Manu Saunders an ecologist at the University of New England in Australia says Across whole forests there are millions of individuals and hundreds of different species in those forests that all rely on each other And if you lose one it s like a link in a chain you then lose the others that it is connected to The loss here is almost hard to fathom A staggering 1 25 billion animals are now estimated dead though there s a good deal of uncertainty in that figure Many wild animals and some farm animals have been killed directly by the flames We can see the evidence with our own eyes Distressing images of burned kangaroos and koalas and videos of dead animals on the sides of the roads have circulated online over the past week Other animals have not been burned alive but have faced death due to the destruction of their natural environment which they rely on for food and shelter Initially the number of animals killed was put at 480 million an estimate that came from Chris Dickman a biodiversity expert at the University of Sydney The truth is it s hard for anyone to know the precise impact of the fires at this stage not least because many animals that survive the flames will likely die later due to lack of food water and shelter Regardless of the exact numbers this is a crisis for biodiversity in Australia which is home to some of Earth s most distinctive animals like marsupials But it s not just charismatic animals like koalas of which around 8 000 have died while others are desperate for water Even the loss of insects matters Invertebrates are absolutely critical for ecosystem function Saunders says And they re in harm s way too They are the ones that build ecosystems from the ground up They decompose decaying matter they aerate the soil they pollinate the plants which then create the forests The invertebrates are the ones that are structuring those systems even though they might be invisible or we don t think about them so much Where there s fire well you know Smoke It s hard to overstate just how much smoke has been created Compare the NASA Landsat satellite image on the left of the southeast coast on July 24 2019 to the same region on New Year s Day during some of the most intense fires this season The smoke is so plentiful that NOAA reported it s in the process of circumnavigating the planet showing up over South America after being pushed there by the wind Smoke is a hazard in itself It s an irritating pollutant that exacerbates respiratory illnesses and heart problems Fine particles from the smoke and soot can be smaller than 2 5 micrometers tiny enough to lodge themselves into the crannies of the lungs and pass into the bloodstream The biggest health threat from smoke comes from fine particles the US Environmental Protection Agency explains These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system where they can cause health problems such as burning eyes runny nose and illnesses such as bronchitis Fine particles also can aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases and even are linked to premature deaths in people with these conditions The pace of destruction of Australia s wildlife is eye popping Thousands of people are suffering too States of emergency have been declared in New South Wales and Victoria and army reserve troops have been called up to assist in recovery efforts Australia s firefighting force is largely made up of volunteers many of whom have had to forgo weeks of work at their regular jobs to fight the blazes Their work has been very difficult The pace at which the bushfires have spread and the subsequent heavy smoke have made it difficult for emergency services to access and evacuate some communities at times forcing residents to flee to beaches and other water bodies to avoid impact and await rescue the Red Cross reported January 8 In one case 4 000 people in Mallacoota Victoria headed to the beach to be rescued The main road heading into their town had been closed off Power fuel and food supplies have been severely interrupted to some communities and road closures have been common the Red Cross continues This has resulted in some communities being isolated or only accessible by air or sea when smoke conditions allow Australia s government created a new National Bushfire Recovery Agency to help fund fire relief and authorized payments to volunteer firefighters some of whom have now spent months on duty However Australia s elected leaders have been reluctant to confront the country s contributions to climate change a major factor in the bushfires Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and both of Australia s major parties are courting support from the country s powerful mining industry Prime Minister Scott Morrison in particular has refused to connect the dots between Australia s reliance on coal its greenhouse gas emissions the ongoing blazes and the consequences for Australians Beyond the immediate destruction from the bushfires Australians face other risks to their well being which will persist long after the fires are subdued The extreme stress of losing homes livelihoods pets and property can be difficult to cope with As always in a natural disaster mental health is a concern After a major disaster studies find a 5 percent to 15 percent increase in the incidence of mental health problems among survivors And there will be a lot of rebuilding to do The environmental crisis doesn t end either when the fires go out When rains come all the charred debris from the fire may wash into freshwater sources polluting it for both aquatic life and human consumption On dry land animals will continue to suffer too There s going to be ongoing mortalities i e deaths as the result of starvation there will be nothing to eat and the lack of shelter says Sarah Legge an ecologist at the Australian National University who studies how species respond to fire Feral predators like cats and foxes will be attracted to burned areas she says and they ll mop up all the native animals that are left there over the next few months Which is all to say Even after the fires cease don t turn your attention away from Australia Related

semblance of a sense of crisis Mark Greenhill tells me as we sit in his mayoral office in Katoomba a small town some 100 kilometers west of Sydney It is December 19 For over a month three massive bushfires have plagued this small mountain community a UNESCO World Heritage site ravaging its ecosystem and laying waste to residents homes I could smell the smoke in Sydney that morning the haze descended on the city at least a dozen times in the past month casting a sepia toned pall and tripping office fire alarms But it was nothing compared with Katoomba where my eyes began to burn the moment I stepped off the train 1 Ad Policy function load_article_ads if jQuery ad halfpage 337121 0 is empty call_ad_new halfpage tn_article ad halfpage 337121 0 rectangle_1 tn_author daniel j

second of a three part series on climate justice You can read the first installment here As Greenhill speaks his eyes dart to the window behind me Oh fuck he says I turn to look A thick gray plume is billowing up from the trees just north of us He jumps up and rushes to the window That is a cloud of fire he says That s climate change right there A moment passes as the two of us stand in silence So so he continues picking up his train of thought there s no sense of that national crisis And that s what we re missing He points back to the fire cloud I m just going to find out what that is and begins texting furiously 2 The technical term for what we saw that day is pyrocumulonimbus or pyroCb for short PyroCbs are weather events generated by wildfires They can produce dry lightning storms high winds even full blown tornadoes An aerial photo of the Hiroshima bombing long thought to capture the distinctive nuclear mushroom cloud was only recently reidentified as an image of the pyroCb from the ensuing firestorm that swept through the city In recent weeks pyroCb has become a household term in Australia a literal manifestation of the fires but also a symbol nudging us to see what is happening to the country in the terms of armed conflict As the fires tear through town after town with ruthless efficiency pyroCbs lend them the look of an airborne attack climate blitzkrieg When Prime Minister Scott Morrison called in the navy to evacuate thousands of people stranded on beaches and mobilized the Australian Defence Force to help fight the fires the symbolism became reality Australia went to war with itself 3 An uncanny effect of the climate crisis The way we describe the world no longer lines up with the way the world is A smoke free zone reads a sign on Katoomba s main street Similar notices are posted throughout downtown Sydney The fires have made them ironic Meanwhile a host of common metaphors can t handle the heat playing with fire have become uselessly literal much in the way that trump is now a tainted verb And then there are moments when reality has turned so surreal that our depictions of it become the ghostly receipts of normality In Katoomba tourists have begun taking selfies in front of posters of its famed mountain vista the real view is hidden behind a screen of smoke Such dissonances seem trivial when compared with the destruction wrought by the fires But I found them profoundly disturbing to witness They are signs that the link between the world and our words is beginning to fray 4 Related Article In Senegal Climate Change Is Robbing Thousands of Their Homes Daniel Judt Perhaps the most brutal irony of all has been the Australian government s response to the crisis Much attention has been paid to the Morrison government s complacency the inadequate provision of aid a prime minister who opted for a secretive holiday in Hawaii while public servants and volunteers begged for government help But one of the unintended effects of this inaction has been to distract from what the government was doing during the crisis While the bushfires raged in Australia the country s delegates to the United Nations climate negotiations in Madrid helped undermine international climate policy by insisting through obvious accounting tricks that amounted to lies that Australia is also taking real action on climate change and we re getting results as Morrison put it But which results exactly did the prime minister have in mind The catastrophic fires The unlivable cities The deaths of his citizens 5 A pall Satellite photos show smoke over Kangaroo Island NASA Once climate change becomes a crisis in wealthy white majority Western nations then surely we will act This has long been an unspoken tenet of climate politics a terrible but surefire last resort and it is a statement I heard all the time in Australia These fires are so severe so terrible so impossible to ignore that something will have to give There s no way that politicians cannot react Julie Anne Richards the executive director of Climate Action Network Australia tells me by phone as I ride the train back from Katoomba to Sydney queasy from the smoke There s no way that people experience what we re experiencing right now and forget that by the next election This is one way to understand the fires as the beginning of the end of climate inaction a darkly apt coda to the year the world woke up to the climate crisis 6 And yet here and whenever else I heard it this view was less a conviction than a hope And behind that hope a fear that somewhere along the path from the country s climate crisis to its climate politics something was broken Perhaps the fear goes the lesson from these fires will be that there is nothing inevitable about the link between a harsher more present climate crisis and better climate politics Perhaps it is just the opposite The deeper the crisis the harder it becomes to act 7 Current Issue

a rare combination of perpetrator and victim Its politics are steeped in denial its politicians beholden to fossil fuel and mining interests How catastrophes like these fires clear stinging evidence of the climate crisis that the country s policies have helped cause will impact those politics is one of the most important questions of the next decade 8 Just before he spots the fire cloud Greenhill spreads a map of the Blue Mountains on the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me gesturing to the northern part of the map where the Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned over 1 000 000 acres So this hits us in the next few days probably Wind changes towards the back end of the next couple weeks he continues sweeping his hand northward from the southeast where two more fires are threatening to combine So we face the prospect of being hit from this side and being hit from this side north and south That s never happened before 9 Australia has seen many terrible fire seasons In 2003 fires swept through the suburbs of Canberra the nation s capital killing four people and destroying hundreds of homes In 2009 bushfires in the state of Victoria killed 173 people in a single day the worst bushfire disaster in Australian history now referred to simply as Black Saturday But every climate scientist and firefighter I spoke with confirmed Greenhill s claim It has never been like this 10 The conditions are unprecedented Back to back droughts have turned even rain forests into kindling With the droughts has come heat Last year was the hottest on record in Australia December 17 was the hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains which makes it the hottest place not just in Australia but in the world And with the heat come winds dessicatingly dry in the words of one expert that whip up fires and smuggle embers across the containment lines 11 var

own unpredictable weather systems including a fire tornado exactly what it sounds like that flipped a 10 ton fire truck in the southeastern town of Jingellic in December killing a firefighter Greg Mullins a former fire commissioner of New South Wales tells me that in his 48 years of firefighting he had never seen conditions this severe I m seeing things that I don t understand he says Other former chiefs from different states confirm this sentiment Naomi Brown a former head of the Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council tells me this season hit us like a train 12 The consequences of the fires are unprecedented as well with more than 2 000 homes destroyed at least 28 people dead and over 26 million acres burned compared with 1 9 million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires themselves 400 million tons of carbon dioxide at the time of writing which is well over half the amount that Australia emitted in 2018 13 Article Inline Ads Calling var art_inline_ad_337121 true

tells me Climate scientists have been predicting this kind of catastrophic fire season for years he adds 14 And we are nowhere near the end Australia s worst fires normally occur in late January and early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes home Protesters outside the residence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known Jenny Evans Getty Images While we re waiting for news about the fire cloud Greenhill drives me to one of Katoomba s lookout points in the mayoral limo his Kia Rio As he winds up the deserted mountain roads the Rural Fire Service has closed most of them I ask him for a quick stock take Enough fire volunteers He laughs No Nowhere near A portion of our trucks are actually in other parts of the state fighting fires so we re really stretched he says Water levels Shit About 30 percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a uniform orange brown so irrevocably parched that it is hard to see how it ever had been or could be otherwise Worst case scenario is that we get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a

reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated This is the second of a three part series on climate justice You can read the first installment here As Greenhill speaks his eyes dart to the window behind me Oh fuck he says I turn to look A thick gray plume is billowing up from the trees just north of us He jumps up and rushes to the window That is a cloud of fire he says That s climate change right there A moment passes as the two of us stand in silence So so he continues picking up his train of thought there s no sense of that national crisis And that s what we re missing He points back to the fire cloud I m just going to find out what that is and begins texting furiously 2 The technical term for what we saw that day is pyrocumulonimbus or pyroCb for short PyroCbs are weather events generated by wildfires They can produce dry lightning storms high winds even full blown tornadoes An aerial photo of the Hiroshima bombing long thought to capture the distinctive nuclear mushroom cloud was only recently reidentified as an image of the pyroCb from the ensuing firestorm that swept through the city In recent weeks pyroCb has become a household term in Australia a literal manifestation of the fires but also a symbol nudging us to see what is happening to the country in the terms of armed conflict As the fires tear through town after town with ruthless efficiency pyroCbs lend them the look of an airborne attack climate blitzkrieg When Prime Minister Scott Morrison called in the navy to evacuate thousands of people stranded on beaches and mobilized the Australian Defence Force to help fight the fires the symbolism became reality Australia went to war with itself 3 An uncanny effect of the climate crisis The way we describe the world no longer lines up with the way the world is A smoke free zone reads a sign on Katoomba s main street Similar notices are posted throughout downtown Sydney The fires have made them ironic Meanwhile a host of common metaphors can t handle the heat playing with fire have become uselessly literal much in the way that trump is now a tainted verb And then there are moments when reality has turned so surreal that our depictions of it become the ghostly receipts of normality In Katoomba tourists have begun taking selfies in front of posters of its famed mountain vista the real view is hidden behind a screen of smoke Such dissonances seem trivial when compared with the destruction wrought by the fires But I found them profoundly disturbing to witness They are signs that the link between the world and our words is beginning to fray 4 Related Article In Senegal Climate Change Is Robbing Thousands of Their Homes Daniel Judt Perhaps the most brutal irony of all has been the Australian government s response to the crisis Much attention has been paid to the Morrison government s complacency the inadequate provision of aid a prime minister who opted for a secretive holiday in Hawaii while public servants and volunteers begged for government help But one of the unintended effects of this inaction has been to distract from what the government was doing during the crisis While the bushfires raged in Australia the country s delegates to the United Nations climate negotiations in Madrid helped undermine international climate policy by insisting through obvious accounting tricks that amounted to lies that Australia is also taking real action on climate change and we re getting results as Morrison put it But which results exactly did the prime minister have in mind The catastrophic fires The unlivable cities The deaths of his citizens 5 A pall Satellite photos show smoke over Kangaroo Island NASA Once climate change becomes a crisis in wealthy white majority Western nations then surely we will act This has long been an unspoken tenet of climate politics a terrible but surefire last resort and it is a statement I heard all the time in Australia These fires are so severe so terrible so impossible to ignore that something will have to give There s no way that politicians cannot react Julie Anne Richards the executive director of Climate Action Network Australia tells me by phone as I ride the train back from Katoomba to Sydney queasy from the smoke There s no way that people experience what we re experiencing right now and forget that by the next election This is one way to understand the fires as the beginning of the end of climate inaction a darkly apt coda to the year the world woke up to the climate crisis 6 And yet here and whenever else I heard it this view was less a conviction than a hope And behind that hope a fear that somewhere along the path from the country s climate crisis to its climate politics something was broken Perhaps the fear goes the lesson from these fires will be that there is nothing inevitable about the link between a harsher more present climate crisis and better climate politics Perhaps it is just the opposite The deeper the crisis the harder it becomes to act 7 Current Issue View our current issue var magazine_text_337121 var magazine_button_text_337121 var

hottest on record in Australia December 17 was the hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120

get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var inline_cta_2_text_337121 var inline_cta_2_button_text_337121 var inline_cta_2_url_337121 var inline_cta_2_bg_color_337121 var

inline_cta_2_module_337121 addClass tn inline cta module Both later reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated The technical term for what we saw that day is pyrocumulonimbus or pyroCb for short PyroCbs are weather events generated by wildfires They can produce dry lightning storms high winds even full blown tornadoes An aerial photo of the Hiroshima bombing long thought to capture the distinctive nuclear mushroom cloud was only recently reidentified as an image of the pyroCb from the ensuing firestorm that swept through the city In recent weeks pyroCb has become a household term in Australia a literal manifestation of the fires but also a symbol nudging us to see what is happening to the country in the terms of armed conflict As the fires tear through town after town with ruthless efficiency pyroCbs lend them the look of an airborne attack climate blitzkrieg When Prime Minister Scott Morrison called in the navy to evacuate thousands of people stranded on beaches and mobilized the Australian Defence Force to help fight the fires the symbolism became reality Australia went to war with itself 3 An uncanny effect of the climate crisis The way we describe the world no longer lines up with the way the world is A smoke free zone reads a sign on Katoomba s main street Similar notices are posted throughout downtown Sydney The fires have made them ironic Meanwhile a host of common metaphors can t handle the heat playing with fire have become uselessly literal much in the way that trump is now a tainted verb And then there are moments when reality has turned so surreal that our depictions of it become the ghostly receipts of normality In Katoomba tourists have begun taking selfies in front of posters of its famed mountain vista the real view is hidden behind a screen of smoke Such dissonances seem trivial when compared with the destruction wrought by the fires But I found them profoundly disturbing to witness They are signs that the link between the world and our words is beginning to fray 4 Related Article In Senegal Climate Change Is Robbing Thousands of Their Homes Daniel Judt Perhaps the most brutal irony of all has been the Australian government s response to the crisis Much attention has been paid to the Morrison government s complacency the inadequate provision of aid a prime minister who opted for a secretive holiday in Hawaii while public servants and volunteers begged for government help But one of the unintended effects of this inaction has been to distract from what the government was doing during the crisis While the bushfires raged in Australia the country s delegates to the United Nations climate negotiations in Madrid helped undermine international climate policy by insisting through obvious accounting tricks that amounted to lies that Australia is also taking real action on climate change and we re getting results as Morrison put it But which results exactly did the prime minister have in mind The catastrophic fires The unlivable cities The deaths of his citizens 5 A pall Satellite photos show smoke over Kangaroo Island NASA Once climate change becomes a crisis in wealthy white majority Western nations then surely we will act This has long been an unspoken tenet of climate politics a terrible but surefire last resort and it is a statement I heard all the time in Australia These fires are so severe so terrible so impossible to ignore that something will have to give There s no way that politicians cannot react Julie Anne Richards the executive director of Climate Action Network Australia tells me by phone as I ride the train back from Katoomba to Sydney queasy from the smoke There s no way that people experience what we re experiencing right now and forget that by the next election This is one way to understand the fires as the beginning of the end of climate inaction a darkly apt coda to the year the world woke up to the climate crisis 6 And yet here and whenever else I heard it this view was less a conviction than a hope And behind that hope a fear that somewhere along the path from the country s climate crisis to its climate politics something was broken Perhaps the fear goes the lesson from these fires will be that there is nothing inevitable about the link between a harsher more present climate crisis and better climate politics Perhaps it is just the opposite The deeper the crisis the harder it becomes to act 7 Current Issue

spreads a map of the Blue Mountains on the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me gesturing to the northern part of the map where the Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned over 1 000 000 acres So this hits us in the next few days probably

nation s capital killing four people and destroying hundreds of homes In 2009 bushfires in the state of Victoria killed 173 people in a single day the worst bushfire disaster in Australian history now referred to simply as Black Saturday But every climate scientist and firefighter I spoke with confirmed Greenhill s claim It has never been like this 10 The conditions are unprecedented Back to back droughts have turned even rain forests into kindling With the droughts has come heat Last year was the hottest on record in Australia December 17 was the hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains which makes it the hottest

to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires

tells me Climate scientists have been predicting this kind of catastrophic fire season for years he adds 14 And we are nowhere near the end Australia s worst fires normally occur in late January and early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes home Protesters outside the residence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known Jenny Evans Getty Images While we re waiting for news about the fire cloud Greenhill drives me to one of Katoomba s lookout points in the mayoral limo his Kia Rio As he winds up the deserted mountain roads the Rural Fire Service has closed most of them I ask him for a quick stock take Enough fire volunteers He laughs No Nowhere near A portion of our trucks are actually in other parts of the state fighting fires so we re really stretched he says Water levels Shit About 30 percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a uniform orange brown so irrevocably parched that it is hard to see how it ever had been or could be otherwise Worst case scenario is that we get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var

reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated An uncanny effect of the climate crisis The way we describe the world no longer lines up with the way the world is A smoke free zone reads a sign on Katoomba s main street Similar notices are posted throughout downtown Sydney The fires have made them ironic Meanwhile a host of common metaphors can t handle the heat playing with fire have become uselessly literal much in the way that trump is now a tainted verb And then there are moments when reality has turned so surreal that our depictions of it become the ghostly receipts of normality In Katoomba tourists have begun taking selfies in front of posters of its famed mountain vista the real view is hidden behind a screen of smoke Such dissonances seem trivial when compared with the destruction wrought by the fires But I found them profoundly disturbing to witness They are signs that the link between the world and our words is beginning to fray 4 Related Article In Senegal Climate Change Is Robbing Thousands of Their Homes Daniel Judt Perhaps the most brutal irony of all has been the Australian government s response to the crisis Much attention has been paid to the Morrison government s complacency the inadequate provision of aid a prime minister who opted for a secretive holiday in Hawaii while public servants and volunteers begged for government help But one of the unintended effects of this inaction has been to distract from what the government was doing during the crisis While the bushfires raged in Australia the country s delegates to the United Nations climate negotiations in Madrid helped undermine international climate policy by insisting through obvious accounting tricks that amounted to lies that Australia is also taking real action on climate change and we re getting results as Morrison put it But which results exactly did the prime minister have in mind The catastrophic fires The unlivable cities The deaths of his citizens 5 A pall Satellite photos show smoke over Kangaroo Island NASA Once climate change becomes a crisis in wealthy white majority Western nations then surely we will act This has long been an unspoken tenet of climate politics a terrible but surefire last resort and it is a statement I heard all the time in Australia These fires are so severe so terrible so impossible to ignore that something will have to give There s no way that politicians cannot react Julie Anne Richards the executive director of Climate Action Network Australia tells me by phone as I ride the train back from Katoomba to Sydney queasy from the smoke There s no way that people experience what we re experiencing right now and forget that by the next election This is one way to understand the fires as the beginning of the end of climate inaction a darkly apt coda to the year the world woke up to the climate crisis 6 And yet here and whenever else I heard it this view was less a conviction than a hope And behind that hope a fear that somewhere along the path from the country s climate crisis to its climate politics something was broken Perhaps the fear goes the lesson from these fires will be that there is nothing inevitable about the link between a harsher more present climate crisis and better climate politics Perhaps it is just the opposite The deeper the crisis the harder it becomes to act 7 Current Issue View our current issue var magazine_text_337121 var magazine_button_text_337121 var magazine_button_url_337121 var

most important questions of the next decade 8 Just before he spots the fire cloud Greenhill spreads a map of the Blue Mountains on the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me gesturing to the northern part of the map where the Gospers Mountain mega

hottest on record in Australia December 17 was the hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120

Authorities Council tells me this season hit us like a train 12 The consequences of the fires are unprecedented as well with more than 2 000 homes destroyed at least 28 people dead and over 26 million acres burned compared with 1 9 million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the

culprit David Bowman a fire expert at the University of Tasmania tells me Climate scientists have been predicting this kind of catastrophic fire season for years he adds 14 And we are nowhere near the end Australia s worst fires normally occur in late January and early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes home Protesters outside the residence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known Jenny Evans Getty Images While we re waiting for news about the fire cloud Greenhill drives me to one of Katoomba s lookout points in the mayoral limo his Kia Rio As he winds up the deserted mountain roads the Rural Fire Service has closed most of them I ask him for a quick stock take Enough fire volunteers He laughs No Nowhere near A portion of our trucks are actually in other parts of the state fighting fires so we re really stretched he says Water levels Shit About 30 percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a uniform orange brown so irrevocably parched that it is hard to see how it ever had been or could be otherwise Worst case scenario is that we get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var inline_cta_2_text_337121 var inline_cta_2_button_text_337121 var inline_cta_2_url_337121 var inline_cta_2_bg_color_337121 var

inline_cta_2_module_337121 addClass tn inline cta module Both later reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated Daniel Judt Perhaps the most brutal irony of all has been the Australian government s response to the crisis Much attention has been paid to the Morrison government s complacency the inadequate provision of aid a prime minister who opted for a secretive holiday in Hawaii while public servants and volunteers begged for government help But one of the unintended effects of this inaction has been to distract from what the government was doing during the crisis While the bushfires raged in Australia the country s delegates to the United Nations climate negotiations in Madrid helped undermine international climate policy by insisting through obvious accounting tricks that amounted to lies that Australia is also taking real action on climate change and we re getting results as Morrison put it But which results exactly did the prime minister have in mind The catastrophic fires The unlivable cities The deaths of his citizens 5 A pall Satellite photos show smoke over Kangaroo Island NASA Once climate change becomes a crisis in wealthy white majority Western nations then surely we will act This has long been an unspoken tenet of climate politics a terrible but surefire last resort and it is a statement I heard all the time in Australia These fires are so severe so terrible so impossible to ignore that something will have to give There s no way that politicians cannot react Julie Anne Richards the executive director of Climate Action Network Australia tells me by phone as I ride the train back from Katoomba to Sydney queasy from the smoke There s no way that people experience what we re experiencing right now and forget that by the next election This is one way to understand the fires as the beginning of the end of climate inaction a darkly apt coda to the year the world woke up to the climate crisis 6 And yet here and whenever else I heard it this view was less a conviction than a hope And behind that hope a fear that somewhere along the path from the country s climate crisis to its climate politics something was broken Perhaps the fear goes the lesson from these fires will be that there is nothing inevitable about the link between a harsher more present climate crisis and better climate politics Perhaps it is just the opposite The deeper the crisis the harder it becomes to act 7 Current Issue

spreads a map of the Blue Mountains on the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me gesturing to the northern part of the map where the Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned over 1 000 000 acres So this hits us in the next few days probably Wind changes towards the back end of the next couple weeks he continues sweeping his hand northward from the southeast where two more fires are threatening to combine So we face the prospect of being

national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains which makes it the hottest

tells me Climate scientists have been predicting this kind of catastrophic fire season for years he adds 14 And we are nowhere near the end Australia s worst fires normally occur in late January and early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes home Protesters outside the residence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known Jenny Evans Getty Images While we re waiting for news about the fire cloud Greenhill drives me to one of Katoomba s lookout points in the mayoral limo his Kia Rio As he winds up the deserted mountain roads the Rural Fire Service has closed most of them I ask him for a quick stock take Enough fire volunteers He laughs No Nowhere near A portion of our trucks are actually in other parts of the state fighting fires so we re really stretched he says Water levels Shit About 30 percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a uniform orange brown so irrevocably parched that it is hard to see how it ever had been or could be otherwise Worst case scenario is that we get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var

reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated A pall Satellite photos show smoke over Kangaroo Island NASA Once climate change becomes a crisis in wealthy white majority Western nations then surely we will act This has long been an unspoken tenet of climate politics a terrible but surefire last resort and it is a statement I heard all the time in Australia These fires are so severe so terrible so impossible to ignore that something will have to give There s no way that politicians cannot react Julie Anne Richards the executive director of Climate Action Network Australia tells me by phone as I ride the train back from Katoomba to Sydney queasy from the smoke There s no way that people experience what we re experiencing right now and forget that by the next election This is one way to understand the fires as the beginning of the end of climate inaction a darkly apt coda to the year the world woke up to the climate crisis 6 And yet here and whenever else I heard it this view was less a conviction than a hope And behind that hope a fear that somewhere along the path from the country s climate crisis to its climate politics something was broken Perhaps the fear goes the lesson from these fires will be that there is nothing inevitable about the link between a harsher more present climate crisis and better climate politics Perhaps it is just the opposite The deeper the crisis the harder it becomes to act 7 Current Issue View our current issue var magazine_text_337121 var

the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me

and destroying hundreds of homes In 2009 bushfires in the state of Victoria killed 173 people in a single day the worst bushfire disaster in Australian history now referred to simply as Black Saturday But every climate scientist and firefighter I spoke with confirmed Greenhill s claim It has never been like this 10 The conditions are unprecedented Back to back droughts have turned even rain forests into kindling With the droughts has come heat Last year was the hottest on record in Australia December 17 was the hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains which makes it the hottest place not just in Australia but in the world

consequences of the fires are unprecedented as well with more than 2 000 homes destroyed at least 28 people dead and over 26 million acres burned compared with 1 9 million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires themselves 400 million tons of carbon dioxide at the time of writing which is well over half the amount that Australia emitted in 2018 13 Article Inline Ads Calling var art_inline_ad_337121 true

early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes home Protesters outside the residence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known Jenny Evans Getty Images While we re waiting for news about the fire cloud Greenhill drives me to one of Katoomba s lookout points in the mayoral limo his Kia Rio As he winds up the deserted mountain roads the Rural Fire Service has closed most of them I ask him for a quick stock take Enough fire volunteers He laughs No Nowhere near A portion of our trucks are actually in other parts of the state fighting fires so we re really stretched he says Water levels Shit About 30 percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a uniform orange brown so irrevocably parched that it is hard to see how it ever had been or could be otherwise Worst case scenario is that we get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var

reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated And yet here and whenever else I heard it this view was less a conviction than a hope And behind that hope a fear that somewhere along the path from the country s climate crisis to its climate politics something was broken Perhaps the fear goes the lesson from these fires will be that there is nothing inevitable about the link between a harsher more present climate crisis and better climate politics Perhaps it is just the opposite The deeper the crisis the harder it becomes to act 7 Current Issue View our current issue var magazine_text_337121 var magazine_button_text_337121 var magazine_button_url_337121 var magazine_button_bg_color_337121 var

spots the fire cloud Greenhill spreads a map of the Blue Mountains on the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me gesturing to the northern part of the map where the Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned over 1 000 000 acres So this hits us in the next few days probably Wind changes towards the back end of the next couple weeks he continues sweeping his hand northward from the southeast where two more fires are threatening to combine So we

country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains which

million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires themselves 400 million tons of carbon dioxide at the time of writing which is well over half the amount that Australia emitted in 2018 13 Article Inline Ads Calling var

do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to

tn inline cta module Both later reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated In terms of climate justice Australia is a rare combination of perpetrator and victim Its politics are steeped in denial its politicians beholden to fossil fuel and mining interests How catastrophes like these fires clear stinging evidence of the climate crisis that the country s policies have helped cause will impact those politics is one of the most important questions of the next decade 8 Just before he spots the fire cloud Greenhill spreads a map of the Blue Mountains on the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me gesturing to the northern part of the map where the Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned over 1 000 000 acres So this hits us in the next few days probably Wind changes towards the back end of the next couple weeks he continues sweeping his hand northward from the southeast where two more fires are threatening to combine So we face the prospect of being hit from this side and being hit from this side north and south That s never happened before 9 Australia has seen many terrible fire seasons In 2003 fires swept through the suburbs of Canberra the nation s capital killing four people and destroying hundreds of homes In 2009 bushfires in the state of Victoria killed 173 people in a single day the worst bushfire disaster in Australian history now referred to simply as Black Saturday But every climate scientist and firefighter I spoke with confirmed Greenhill s claim It has never been like this 10 The conditions are unprecedented Back to back droughts have turned even rain forests into kindling With the droughts has come heat Last year was the hottest on record in Australia December 17 was the hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains which makes it the hottest place not just in Australia but in the world And with the heat come winds dessicatingly dry in the words of one expert that whip up fires and smuggle embers across the containment lines 11 var

former chiefs from different states confirm this sentiment Naomi Brown a former head of the Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council tells me this season hit us like a train 12 The consequences of the fires are unprecedented as well with more than 2 000 homes destroyed at least 28 people dead and over 26 million acres burned compared with 1 9 million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires themselves 400 million tons of carbon dioxide at the time of writing which is well over half the amount that Australia emitted in 2018 13 Article Inline Ads Calling var art_inline_ad_337121 true

early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that

Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes

reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated Just before he spots the fire cloud Greenhill spreads a map of the Blue Mountains on the table in front of us The region includes Katoomba and a number of other mountain communities in normally lush green forests We ve got winds pushing this fire south at the moment he tells me gesturing to the northern part of the map where the Gospers Mountain mega fire has already burned over 1 000 000 acres So this hits us in the next few days probably Wind changes towards the back end of the next couple weeks he continues sweeping his hand northward from the southeast where two more fires are threatening to combine So we face the prospect of being hit from this side and being hit from this side north and south That s never happened before 9 Australia has seen many terrible fire seasons In 2003 fires swept through the suburbs of Canberra the nation s capital killing four people and destroying hundreds of homes In 2009 bushfires in the state of Victoria killed 173 people in a single day the worst bushfire disaster in Australian history now referred to simply as Black Saturday But every climate scientist and firefighter I spoke with confirmed Greenhill s claim It has never been like this 10 The conditions are unprecedented Back to back droughts have turned even rain forests into kindling With the droughts has come heat Last year was the hottest on record in Australia December 17 was the hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains which makes it the hottest place not just in Australia but in the world And with the heat come winds dessicatingly dry in the words of one expert that whip up fires and smuggle embers across the containment lines 11 var inline_cta_text_337121

consequences of the fires are unprecedented as well with more than 2 000 homes destroyed at least 28 people dead and over 26 million acres burned compared with 1 9 million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires themselves 400 million tons of carbon dioxide at the time of writing which is well over half the amount that Australia emitted in 2018 13 Article Inline Ads Calling var art_inline_ad_337121 true

early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes

percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a

Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a

use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated Australia has seen many terrible fire seasons In 2003 fires swept through the suburbs of Canberra the nation s capital killing four people and destroying hundreds of homes In 2009 bushfires in the state of Victoria killed 173 people in a single day the worst

hottest day in the country s history with a national maximum average of 105 6 degrees Fahrenheit As I write on the afternoon of January 4 it is 120 degrees in the town of Penrith at the base of the

acres burned compared with 1 9 million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires themselves 400 million tons of carbon dioxide at the time of writing which is well over half the amount that Australia emitted in 2018 13

inline_cta_2_module_337121 addClass tn inline cta module Both later reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections

this severe I m seeing things that I don t understand he says Other former chiefs from different states confirm this sentiment Naomi Brown a former head of the Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council tells me this season hit us like a train 12 The consequences of the fires are unprecedented as well with more than 2 000 homes destroyed at least 28 people dead and over 26 million acres burned compared with 1 9 million acres in California in 2018 to say nothing of the noxious smoke which has spread all the way to Chile and made Canberra the most polluted city in the world Along the country s southeastern coast mass evacuations have been organized by the Australian Navy with the help of Esso an arm of ExxonMobil which dispatched two of its ships from oil rigs to help the stranded The company was ready to assist in whatever way possible according to The Age though presumably that doesn t include curbing its projected 35 percent increase in oil production from now to 2030 And then there s the carbon footprint of the fires themselves 400 million tons of carbon dioxide at the time of writing which is well over half the amount that Australia emitted in 2018 13

January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison

affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David

inline_cta_2_module_337121 addClass tn inline cta module Both later reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of

tn inline cta module Both later reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality

climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated To dispense with the obvious There s no doubt that climate change is the culprit David Bowman a fire expert at the University of Tasmania tells me Climate scientists have been predicting this kind of catastrophic fire season for years he adds 14 And we are nowhere near the end Australia s worst fires normally occur in late January and early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in the landscape 15 Climate comes home Protesters outside the residence of Prime Minister Scott Morrison or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known Jenny Evans Getty Images While we re waiting for news about the fire cloud Greenhill drives me to one of Katoomba s lookout points in the mayoral limo his Kia Rio As he winds up the deserted mountain roads the Rural Fire Service has closed most of them I ask him for a quick stock take Enough fire volunteers He laughs No Nowhere near A portion of our trucks are actually in other parts of the state fighting fires so we re really stretched he says Water levels Shit About 30 percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a uniform orange brown so irrevocably parched that it is hard to see how it ever had been or could be otherwise Worst case scenario is that we get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var

sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that

international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated And we are nowhere near the end Australia s worst fires normally occur in late January and early February The 2003 Canberra fires erupted on January 18 Black Saturday was February 7 2009 We re in the fog of war Bowman exclaims when I ask him how bad the damage will be The only thing that will stop the fires is sustained rain he continues and that may not come for months Look mate he says if you re looking at these weather forecasts and there were no fire right now you d be worried Toward the end of our conversation he says unprompted I just have this sickening sinking feeling And then three times almost to himself There s just too much fire in

Water levels Shit About 30 percent 16 As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d

says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess

surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources

tn inline cta module Both later reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal

that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated As we pull into the lookout I can barely refrain from gasping Smoke spreads across the valleys that surround us The land full of vibrant green in the pictures I d googled hours before is a uniform orange brown so irrevocably parched that it is hard to see how it ever had been or could be otherwise Worst case scenario is that we get smashed on all three sides he says Homes and lives He doesn t even have to say lost 17 As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var inline_cta_2_text_337121 var inline_cta_2_button_text_337121 var

Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated As we retreat from the lookout I ask Greenhill who moved to the Blue Mountains 30 years ago and has been mayor for the past six what he would do in that worst case scenario I ll stay he says decisively I figure it s my job to stay If I go what kind of signal does that send But this is all about climate change he continues Bushfires happen all the time in the Blue Mountains but not like this Not with the bush as dry as it is not with so many fires not with rain that hasn t come and won t come you know fire behavior that I ve never seen before That s why it s part of the climate crisis It s the sheer number and scale of the fires and what sits behind those fires that is truly worrying Later back in his office he tells me I guess there s a sense of dread right now You ve seen the maps The city that I lead and have led for years now is literally surrounded by fire 18 The hottest place On January 4 the temperature in Penrith at the base of the Blue Mountains reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest place on Earth BOM Australia On the day I visited Greenhill Scott Morrison was in Hawaii on his ill timed vacation His office initially insisted that reports of the trip were wrong but sheepishly retracted that after pictures of the prime minister or Scomo as he is not so affectionately known to Australians surfaced of him bro ing it up with Aussie tourists on a beach Only when the deaths began to mount and apocalyptic images made the front page of newspapers around the world did Morrison begin a tour of the affected areas and announce a more robust federal response 19 But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var

reversed their positions But that only paved the way for a second wave of denial the notion that climate change is man made but it isn t Australians who are causing it This has become one of Morrison s main talking points The suggestion in any way shape or form that Australia accountable for 1 3 percent of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that

international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when

pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated But better disaster relief does not imply better climate politics In September David Littleproud the minister for water resources drought rural finance natural disaster and emergency management proclaimed I don t know if climate change is man made In November Michael McCormack the deputy prime minister went on the radio and stringing together a haphazard collection of right wing buzzwords denounced the pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies and inner city raving lunatics who were trying to link the bushfires to climate change 20 var inline_cta_2_text_337121 var inline_cta_2_button_text_337121 var inline_cta_2_url_337121 var

of the world s emissions that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events whether it s here or anywhere else in the world that doesn t bear up to credible scientific evidence he said in November After repeated questions from journalists at a press conference on January 2 he conceded that climate change had worsened the fire season But he has yet to back away from the not Australia s emissions line 21 Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian

16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with

2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated Morrison is relying on the fact that the way we think about responsibility for climate change has lagged the way climate change actually works Of course Australia s emissions are not directly or solely responsible for its fires Would that climate change were so just But the country is the 15th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and its emissions per capita are the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development more than three times the global average Also Australia is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas Until we move beyond understanding responsibility for the climate crisis as a direct correlation between one particular set of emissions and one particular natural disaster politicians like Morrison will keep getting away with their bad faith claims 22 Related Article Australia s Decade of Burning Environmental Apathy Edward Cavanough As the fires worsen into Australia s gravest national crisis since World War II Morrison is leaning hard on another defense He concedes that climate change is real that it is costing Australia lives and land and that reducing emissions will contribute to mitigating the crisis But he insists that Australia has already taken the robust climate action his critics demand The business as usual model gets us there in a canter he said of Australia s emissions reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets he asserted in a recent press conference 23 This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than

in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as

Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to

one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be

that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated This is a different strain of denial not a dismissal of the science or an obfuscation of responsibility but rather a complete reshaping of the past It is the culmination of a decades long effort by Morrison s predecessors to put in place the kinds of deceptive structures accounting tricks low expectations complex legal loopholes that would allow future governments to describe the history of Australia s inaction on climate change as precisely the opposite 24 Pillar of fire Thousands of tourists fled Australia s eastern coast in late December as flames raged out of control and smoke blanketed the beaches Glen Morey AP That effort began in 1997 with the first landmark climate agreement the Kyoto Protocol Under Kyoto Australia was one of the only developed nations that negotiated a commitment to increase its emissions by no more than 8 percent over 1990 levels by 2012 Even at that time this was an absurdly low bar to clear The US agreed to cut its emissions by 7 percent And yet the government wanted more In the final hours of the negotiation the Australian delegation demanded on pain of scuttling the entire protocol that changes in land use count toward emissions calculations The rule has come to be known as the Australia clause 25 Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a

head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated Why land use There was a huge amount of land clearing that had happened in the years before 1990 explains Mark Howden a professor at the Australian National University and a lead author on reports of the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change More land clearing means more emissions from land use but this is only temporary Once the clearing is done land use emissions steadily decrease over time In other words including land use emissions allowed Australia to measure its reductions from an artificially inflated starting point The country could ramp up its fossil fuel use and rely on the expected decline in land use emissions to make the numbers look good 26 That is precisely what happened When land use figures are included Australia emitted just 2 5 percent more in 2012 than it did in 1990 far less than its deceptive Kyoto goal When land use figures are excluded however it emitted 28 3 percent more And that figure does not include emissions from exported fossil fuels a convention that greatly benefits Australia The country s emissions will likely continue to rise in the years to come since the Morrison government does not have a plan to invest in renewables beyond 2020 and the lone piece of federal climate legislation on the books the Climate Solutions Fund is set to receive a total of AU 2 billion over the next decade about as much money as Amtrak receives in a single year from the US government In other words not much To tout these figures as an accomplishment is an astonishing act of bad faith 27 At the recent UN climate negotiations in Madrid Australia went further still In the 2015 Paris Agreement it pledged to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2030 which according to the Climate Analytics a nonprofit climate science and policy group would translate to a mere 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels excluding land use But in Madrid the Australian delegation insisted that the overshooting of its Kyoto pledge be counted toward the calculation of its reductions under the Paris Agreement That way Australia would need to cut its emissions by only 16 percent from 2005 levels to meet its Paris goal the rest would come from its Kyoto credits Yet even if the Paris target is met in earnest it will be wholly insufficient since it is consistent with a rise in average global temperature of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels well above the already dangerous goal of 1 5 degrees 28 This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger

don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government

projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political

much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political response to undesirable truths Arendt feared would be the lie a weapon that extends our ability to change the world into an area that ought to remain beyond our agency To lie is clearly an attempt to change the record she wrote and as such it is a form of action The liar says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are that is he wants to change the world Lying in politics then is action pointed in the wrong direction not toward the future which is up for grabs but toward the present and the past 43 That is the fear behind the hope in Australia Far from providing more of an impetus for political action the reality of the climate crisis may serve to make real action all the more inconceivable In its place comes a perverse kind of climate action a reaction the Morrison government s attempt to wrench Australia s emissions record away from the factual and back into the political The past and the present are treated as parts of the future that is changed back into their former state of potentiality Arendt warned So with climate politics in Australia 44 Fire on the mountain In the heart of the inferno on Gospers Mountain David Gray Getty Images Climate scientists warn of tipping points thresholds that once breached could lead to irreversible changes in the global climate system Tipping points are difficult to predict although we now seem to be approaching some large scale ones at a terrifying pace But there are tipping points in climate politics too and we have arrived at one this summer in Australia Which one though Will the fires send us mercifully toward the dramatic climate action that we now have only a decade to take Or will they mark the moment when the climate crisis became too advanced to be altered and climate action became about cooking our books as our planet staggered toward untold dystopias In the heat of the moment it is hard to tell But at the least it feels possible now to say that we are headed in one direction or the other on the verge of a climate revolution or on the brink of a climate reaction 45 Meanwhile we are left with that strange dissonance the world around us mocking the language we have built to name it The line that has remained stuck in my head is the final sentence of Truth and Politics Conceptually we may call truth what we cannot change wrote Arendt Metaphorically it is the ground on which we stand and the sky that stretches above us Another metaphor that has now become real in Australia where in both senses the ground is burning and the sky is full of smoke 46 Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Labor Party formed a coalition government with the country s Green Party after the 2007 elections This article has been updated This strategy known as carrying over carbon credits from one treaty to another is like accruing rollover minutes on one phone plan and then trying to use them with a different carrier In Madrid dozens of countries pleaded with Australia not to pursue its carryover policy but Australia refused to budge The ensuing anger was fierce Laurence Tubiana a former French environment minister and a key figure in the Paris negotiations told the Financial Times after the Madrid conference that the carryover is just cheating Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement 29 Still marching A rally for climate action outside Sydney Town Hall in January Jenny Evans Getty Images So a country that negotiated a commitment two decades ago to vastly increase its carbon emissions and then proceeded to greatly increase them now wants to use that difference from vast to great to reduce its current reductions pledge which it is not on track to meet even with this creative accounting scheme Small wonder that the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 61 high emitting countries for its climate policies On a scale of 100 possible points the index awarded the Lucky Country a score of zero 30 The Morrison government s response to the bushfires has prompted comparisons to the conservatives response to mass shootings in the United States insisting that now is not the time to politicize the issue shrouding inaction beneath a veil of mourning talking about tangential problems and waiting it out While the analogy is disturbingly apt it doesn t go far enough because it doesn t capture the government s attempt to retroactively write climate action into Australia s past Morrison is no longer saying that the country doesn t need to act on climate change He is saying something far more sinister that we have already acted And by we he means his own Liberal Party On December 22 The Guardian reported that his government adjusted the way emissions are measured so that projected backward emissions during the previous three Labor governments increased while emissions under the Liberal coalition declined 31 So far there have been very few cracks in this Liberal front In mid December the Liberal minister for environment in New South Wales Matt Kean broke ranks with his party to insist that the fires were linked to climate change and that doing nothing is not a solution For this remarkably mild admission he was reprimanded by Australia s army of Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers and by his own party We stand by everything we ve said a skittish press secretary in Kean s office assured me when I called to request an interview But as you can understand we ve had quite a week here He ultimately declined to be interviewed and has since gone silent on climate 32 Nowhere to hide With smoke from the fires detected thousands of miles away activists protested outside the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires Jenny Evans Getty Images None of this was inevitable Only a decade ago Australia was actually poised to lead on climate politics In 2006 according to a poll conducted by the Lowy Institute an Australian think tank 68 percent of Australians agreed with the statement Global warming is a serious and pressing problem and we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs Politicians listened In the 2007 election the Labor Party candidate Kevin Rudd campaigned on the promise of an emissions trading scheme So did John Howard the Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to its 2006 benchmark Climate change became as journalist Annabel Crabb wrote last year the most divisive issue of the Australian political century 34 Meanwhile Labor has spent the last decade toggling between appeals to its working class base in Queensland coal country and demands for a stronger climate policy Last May the party suffered a surprise loss to Morrison s Liberals in what was billed by some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was central to the election Butler concedes that even though our climate policy was not going to directly impact coal mines there was this sort of sense that we didn t support their jobs 35 When I ask the Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made his name in 2017 by presenting a lump of coal in Parliament James Inhofe style and saying This is coal Don t be afraid 36 Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba

Liberal incumbent who a decade earlier oversaw Australia s deceptive accounting at Kyoto When Rudd won the election he set about negotiating an emissions trading scheme with the Liberal opposition led by Malcolm Turnbull It looked as though there would be a genuine consensus on aggressive if wholly market driven climate action 33 Instead negotiations over the trading scheme fell apart Then the Green Party sided with the Liberals in voting against the final bill claiming it was an insufficient response to climate change Labor has never forgiven the Greens for this Greenhill a Labor Party member called the vote a political stunt The Liberals became the party of climate denial and public opinion shifted accordingly By 2012 the Lowy poll showed 36 percent of Australians in favor of immediate significant action on climate change a more than 30 percentage point drop in just six years Since then the figure has climbed steadily reaching 61 percent in 2019 but it has yet to return to

some media outlets as a climate change election Labor leaders maintain that the loss was not a refutation of their climate policies There were a few key factors about why we didn t win the election Mark Butler a Labor MP for Hindmarsh and the current shadow minister for climate change and energy tells me Climate wasn t one of them If the election had been a referendum only about our climate policies he insists I think you may well have seen a different result But when I press him on this Labor suffered key losses in Queensland where the debate over whether to open the Adani coal mine was

Climate Action Network s Richards what has driven this regression in climate policy she immediately replies Two words coal lobby Coal looms over Australian politics and culture Magnates like Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer are easily recognized public figures In the last election Palmer poured AU 60 million into a smear campaign against Labor They knew they d have a friend in Morrison who made

This article has been updated Dotted against this dim backdrop are a few ironic points of light Many of the public servants closest to the fires like Naomi Brown and Greg Mullins have called the government on its lies I think the whole country is being gaslighted right now Brown tells me In April she Mullins and 21 other former emergency service leaders founded the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action and wrote to the federal government warning of increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events They asked for bolstered emergency services and rapid climate action Morrison refused to meet with them 37 I met Brown and Mullins at a press conference in the Sydney Botanical Gardens Standing in front of a fire truck accompanied by four other former fire chiefs they called the press conference to announce the formation of the emergency council on bushfires with or without the prime minister Mullins the group s unofficial leader told me gruffly I will not stand by as some politicians in denial ruin the world and this country The event was a powerful image six retired emergency leaders their faces leathered from decades of firefighting and looking uncomfortable in their business suits throwing their clout behind climate action 38 There are protests too In Sydney the week before Christmas I saw a gathering almost every day from Extinction Rebellion die ins to marches thousands strong across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Morrison s residence I attended one a few days after visiting Katoomba The protesters most of them under 25 kept up a rousing Scomo fuck you all the way to the prime minister s doorstep It was not a joyful gathering You could see hear and feel the anger 39 Related Article What if Australia Were Its Own Planet Bill McKibben But it was despondent anger anger that came from the belief that no change in government would be enough at this point Not Labor they re shit too someone shouted during a speech prompting laughter and applause Richards who attended a march a few days earlier told me she sensed the same thing The mood felt flat she said People don t know what to do They don t want to be resigned but they re fighting that feeling 40 It is not hard to see why The fires are international news now but how long can that last Rain will come eventually and the press will move on The next fire season might not be quite so bad that is always the risk of relying too heavily on weather events to demonstrate climate change And the government is cracking down on climate protests by threatening multiyear prison sentences for activists Perhaps this is going to be the moment when the climate crisis becomes real I say to Mayor Greenhill on our drive up to the lookout in Katoomba Yeah he responds with surprising bitterness and tugs the car roughly into a curve Then winter comes and the bastards forget about it 41 Political theater Images projected onto the Sydney Opera House in support of communities affected by the fires Don Arnold Getty Images There is a line from an essay that has stuck with me throughout my time in Australia lodged in my mind like a song lyric The essay is Truth and Politics by Hannah Arendt Writing in 1967 she asked why it was that lying seemed so much more prevalent in politics than truthtelling to say what is Her answer was that politics is at its core about changing reality breaking free from the world as it is and beginning something entirely new According to this definition truth is a constraint on our ability to alter the conditions around us Seen from the viewpoint of politics truth has a despotic character she wrote When a potential future turns into an actualized present it acquires a stubborn thereness that places it beyond politics It just is 42 The political

The deadly and devastating wildfires that recently charred Australia were worsened by human caused climate change a new study published Wednesday reports Researchers found that climate change increased the chances of Australia experiencing extreme fire weather by at least 30 and likely much more There is evidence that Australian fire seasons have lengthened and become more intense and extreme temperatures have played a role in this said Sophie Lewis a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales in Canberra Australia and a co author of the study Climate change is now part of Australia s landscape extreme heat is clearly influenced by human caused climate change which can influence fire conditions she said Australia s 2019 20 wildfire season burned a record 47 million acres displaced thousands of people and killed at least 34 The fires also razed rare habitats and killed more than a billion animals researchers said 2019 was both Australia s driest and hottest year on record since measurements began a century ago The extended heat wave was the main factor that heightened the fire risk according to the study which was led by researchers from Australia North America and Europe Scientists looked at the Fire Weather Index a measure of weather conditions that describes the risk of wildfires in the areas of southeastern Australia that were most affected by the 2019 20 fires It compared current conditions to the climate as it was around 1900 using observations and climate models According to the researchers the real influence of climate change on the wildfires could be much higher than 30 given that the trend in extreme heat is one of the main factors behind this increase and computer models underestimate the trend in heat This is a highly conservative assessment David Karoly a climate scientist based in Melbourne who was not involved in the analysis told Nature The study was conducted by the World Weather Attribution group an international collaboration that analyzes the possible influence of climate change on extreme weather events such as storms extreme rainfall heat waves cold spells and droughts Contributing The Associated Press ,-1
Fueled by a prolonged drought the wildfires started in Australia in July 2019 Since then more than 17 million acres of land have burned 26 human lives have been lost and about 2 000 homes have been destroyed Critically scientists estimate that nearly one billion animals some of them found only in Australia have perished in the fires However through the wreckage some life has returned to the region One Instagram user Cyn Bodycote was there herself and took photos of the regrowth She said when she took the photos she felt sadness as you think of the wildlife loss but amazement at the green pops of regrowth in the charred bush The bushfires hit the Blue Mountains in New South Wales particularly hard The communities we ve worked with in the Blue Mountains are faced with fire from one direction one week and from the other direction the next firefighter Brendan Hurley said in an opinion piece for ABC News Australia This photo was taken on January 15 outside the home of Australian artist Jenny Kee in Blackheath which was saved by Rural Fire Service volunteers She called the regrowth in the area a miracle I know you wouldn t believe it until you saw it but it happens that quickly like a miracle because it is a miracle it s extraordinary she told the Sydney Morning Herald Instagram user Cyn Bodycote took this photo while visiting the burned region I took a moment just looking as it is hard to take in she said Grass trees Xanthorrhoea grow easily following wildfires The plants which can grow from about 3 feet to nearly 18 feet grow very slowly but can also be very long lived with some surviving from 350 to 450 years One of many species only found in Australia Christmas bells are named for their bell like shape They are the subject the 1909 song My Little Christmas Belle by Australian composer Joe Slater These shrubs are another example of plants that can recover after a bushfire This is due to something called a lignotuber which is a woody swelling of the roots that protects the plant stem There are over 700 species of flowering eucalyptus though most are native to Australia Every state and territory in Australia has its own representative species of eucalpytus The plant has existed for around 50 million years and it has numerous medicinal benefits like being antiseptic and anti inflammatory This koala joey is being rehabilitated at Taronga Zoo in Sydney His original home was in the Blue Mountains Though the fires have devastated the koala population Australian wildlife recovery centers are working to rehabilitate them The bushfires took hold of Kangaroo Island Australia s third largest island on January 4 Sam Mitchell who runs Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park stayed with the animals when the fires moved in We decided that if we can t move them we ll see if we can save them We had the army helping us Somehow we were spared It burnt right around us he told the BBC Kangaroos are a symbol of Australia and they are only found on the continent Volunteers have been taking care of orphaned kangaroos no longer able to grow inside their mothers pouches Wallabies look like mini kangaroos and are grouped in categories based on where they live There are shrub wallabies brush wallabies and rock wallabies Australia is helping wildlife like wallabies recover by dropping vegetables from helicopters Volunteers like Sarah Price who works for wildlife rescue group WIRES are helping to save and rehabilitate animals from the months long wildfire disaster in Australia The government has created a National Bushfire Recovery Fund With an initial 2 billion the agency will support rebuilding efforts after the devastating bushfires Like what you see here Subscribe to our daily newsletter to get more of it Sign Up ,-1

the coming weeks and months as a result of lost habitat and food sources This loss is part of a much bigger picture of a world where biodiversity is in steep decline We are losing wildlife at an ever increasing scale across the planet with impacts to ecosystems vital for our own global food production The world s terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated in forests they are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals plants and insects So when forests burn the biodiversity on which humans depend for their long term survival also disappears in the inferno With over 1 million species currently facing extinction if we continue with business as usual extreme weather events such megafires become an increasing matter of concern for species survival A dead Australian

also add to it Until the 2019 2020 Australian bushfire season the forests in Australia were thought to reabsorb all the carbon released in bushfires across the country This would mean the forests achieved net zero emissions However global warming is making bushfires burn more intensely and frequently and the 2019 2020 bushfires have already emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere according to the Copernicus monitoring programme This is as much as Australia s average annual carbon dioxide emissions in just the past three months These will increase Australia s annual greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming and heighten the likelihood of recurring megafires that will release yet more emissions This is a deeply concerning climate feedback loop Thick

Handout via REUTERS Ash from the fires has landed in school playgrounds backyards and is being washed up on Australia s beaches and into freshwater stores and water catchments Drinking water catchments are typically forested areas and so are vulnerable to bushfire pollution Bushfire ash contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous Increased nutrient concentrations can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria commonly known as blue green algae Cyanobacteria produce chemicals which may cause a range of water quality problems including poor taste and odour and sometimes toxic chemicals During a blaze plumes of smoke ash and other debris catch on the wind and scatter across the landscape Sometimes they blow over the ocean where they add nutrients When burned soils flow into streams and rivers they fertilize water plants and algae The extra nutrients can have benefits in moderation but too much can over fertilize and cause excess algal growth Algae absorb oxygen in the water in order to grow and deplete dissolved oxygen when they die and decompose which can asphyxiate fish and other marine life with localized impacts to biodiversity The same can be true in ocean environments where smoke has shown to have a negative impact on marine ecosystems in several past incidents haze from record wildfires in Indonesia killed coral reefs in the late 1990s according to a study in Science as iron rich smoke billowed out over the coast and fertilized the water causing a huge plankton bloom The resulting so called red tide asphyxiated coral reefs around the Mentawai

 The historic wildfires in Australia likely unleashed about 900 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere equivalent to nearly double the country s total yearly fossil fuel emissions according to scientists Although some of the emissions could eventually be offset by forest regrowth researchers worry that the uptick in the heat trapping greenhouse gas could accelerate climate change and portend a new normal for yearly emissions particularly as global warming intensifies wildfires and lengthens fire seasons The full impact of the unprecedented fires in southeastern Australia is not yet known but Rob Jackson a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University said their emissions could hit 1 billion tons by the end of the season For comparison Australia s greenhouse gas emissions from electricity transportation agriculture and industry collectively totaled about 540 million tons from March 2018 to March 2019 We have seen years with extremely high carbon dioxide emissions it s certainly not normal but these numbers are not at all impossible Jackson said of the current wildfire season The real question is What s normal now All wildfires release greenhouse gases but researchers are concerned that huge pulses of carbon emissions from devastating fire seasons made worse by climate change could overwhelm natural reservoirs that store carbon dioxide and outpace the planet s ability to offset these extreme events Over the past decade Australia s national fire related emissions averaged about 485 million tons a year according to the European Union s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service which tracks air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide On Jan 6 the agency announced that Australia s wildfires had already released about 400 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere Since then fires have scorched 16 million acres in the states of New South Wales and Victoria leading scientists to more than double their initial estimates of the fire related emissions This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy Terms of Service Although recent heavy rain has helped control some of the blazes Australia is only halfway through its summer and temperatures typically peak in January and February which means the fire risk will likely remain high for months But not all carbon dioxide from wildfires lingers in the atmosphere The planet s global carbon cycle is a complex system in which carbon is naturally stored and exchanged among the atmosphere land oceans rocks and living organisms This system which helps regulate temperatures on Earth is crucial to sustaining life on the planet Plants and the oceans naturally absorb about half the world s carbon emissions But human activities such as burning fossil fuels and extreme events such as intense wildfire seasons are upsetting the delicate balance of the carbon cycle pumping huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere It s just sort of luck that land and oceans are taking up half of what we emit said Richard Houghton a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth Massachusetts Warming is occurring at half the rate that it would be if we didn t have these land and ocean sinks Studies have found that even as global emissions have increased about 50 percent of carbon dioxide is still sequestered by plants and the ocean In other words the more humans emit the more carbon those reservoirs also seem to take up Scientists have struggled to explain this generous absorption and it s not known whether it will happen indefinitely or whether the planet will reach a tipping point For reasons we don t entirely understand the carbon system has been pretty robust so far but that doesn t mean it will go on like that forever Houghton said There are lots of arguments for why these carbon sinks will become saturated but it all remains a bit of a puzzle But even if oceans are effective reservoirs inundating theme with carbon dioxide has other negative effects according to Houghton When it mixes with ocean water carbon dioxide changes the ocean s chemistry and makes the water more acidic which can harm corals shellfish and other sea creatures he said A recent study found that the waters off California are acidifying twice as fast as elsewhere on the planet threatening critical fisheries along the coast while coral reefs are under assault around the world from bleaching events driven by greenhouse gas emissions and warming ocean temperatures Scientists will closely monitor the emissions from Australia s fires Although it s estimated that nearly 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide may have been released other conditions around the world could offset some of the emissions If there are bad fires in Australia releasing a lot of carbon it may be that somewhere else is wetter than normal and is taking up more carbon Houghton said Forest regrowth can also offset emissions but given the severity of the Australian wildfires it could take decades for vegetation to repopulate the scorched areas said Guido van der Werf a scientist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam who helped develop the Global Fire Emissions Database which tracks greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution from wildfires around the world Download the NBC News app for breaking news Over the past several decades the amount of land burned in wildfires worldwide has decreased largely because of changes in land use such as the conversion of savannas for agriculture But in certain regions including Canada the western United States and Australia climate change is increasing the frequency of intense fires and lengthening the fire seasons It s too early to know whether Australia s fires will result in a net increase in global carbon emissions but van der Werf predicts that the blazes will contribute to a blip Fire related emissions around the world account for about 20 percent of global fossil fuel emissions but if climate change increases the severity of wildfires the blazes could become even greater contributors to global warming Is this an exceptional season or is this where we re heading in Australia the western U S and some other places Jackson said If these runaway fires become more normal we re in for a very different world Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on the

Australia s wildfires have destroyed more than a fifth of the country s forests making the blazes globally unprecedented following a years long drought linked to climate change researchers said Monday Climate scientists are currently examining data from the disaster which destroyed swathes of southeastern Australia to determine to what extent they can be attributed to rising temperatures In a special edition of the journal Nature Climate Change Australian researchers examined several other aspects of the blazes including investigations into their extent and possible causes One study showed that between September 2019 and January 2020 around 5 8 million hectares of broadleaf forest were burned in New South Wales and Victoria This accounts for roughly 21 percent of the nation s forested area making this fire season proportionately the most devastating on record Halfway through Spring 2019 we realised that a very large part of the eastern Australian forest could be burned in this single season Matthias Boer from the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University Penrith told AFP The shock came from realising that this season was off the charts globally in terms of the percentage of the continental section of a forest biome that burned Boer said his study almost certainly underestimates the extent of forest loss as the island state of Tasmania was not covered in the data Australia s annual average forest loss to wild fires is typically well below 2 percent Another study published Monday looked at the conditions that made the fires so damaging a years long dry spell in Australia s Murray Darling Basin Droughts create more fuel for wildfires and make it harder for forests to recover after each blaze Andrew King from the University of Melbourne and colleagues looked at a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole IOD which has a direct effect on rainfall levels in Australia and elsewhere Since 2017 much of Australia has experienced widespread drought something the study attributed to a relative lack of negative IOD events when there are warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in the east Indian Ocean with cooler waters in the west These events tend to shift weather patterns and typically bring greater rainfall to southeast Australia and are made less frequent as global sea temperatures warm King and the team examined rainfall statistics and found that the winter of 2016 saw extremely heavy precipitation and a corresponding negative IOD event Since then the Murray Darling Basin has experienced 12 consecutive seasons with below average rainfall the longest period on record since 1900 With climate change there have been projections that there will be more positive IOD events and fewer negative IOD events King told AFP This would mean that we d expect more dry seasons in Australia and possibly worse droughts Boer said that climate change was all but certain to make Australia more prone to wildfires and urged the government to strengthen fire readiness measures and take urgent and effective action on climate change Agence France Presse,-1
The devastating bushfires in New South Wales Australia have finally all been contained officials announced Thursday The fires which began in September after a three year drought destroyed the natural habitats of some of the country s most beloved wildlife including koalas and kangaroos Authorities in New South Wales and Queensland areas where the blazes got most severe declared states of emergency on November 11 The burning hasn t ceased completely but rain finally brought relief this week One billion animals are feared dead from the blazes Emergency relief workers and animal carers have rescued some of the vulnerable creatures that were left without families food or homes In New South Wales wildlife carers Gary Wilson and Julie Willis opened their homes to take in injured and orphaned baby animals According to Reuters the partners had been taking care of baby koalas usually rescued after their mothers were hit by cars for 25 years So now they ve taken in six young kangaroos struggling to survive because of burns a lack of food and ash polluted water We didn t have children ourselves this is what we spend our time doing Willis told Reuters We think it s worthy a worthy cause looking after our babies no matter what they are whether they are kangaroos echidnas or wombats See how the rescued baby kangaroos are adapting to life after the fires Source Reuters Source Reuters The group said its rescue line received over 20 000 calls Source Reuters Some ecosystems have natural wildfires However as humans thin forests turn grassland into farms and build homes in previously untouched areas landscapes can become more prone to burning The Australian bushfires claimed the lives of 27 people and destroyed 2 000 homes Source Chris Dickman University of Sydney They re the official animal of Australia Usually grey kangaroos leave their mothers pouches at around 11 months but continue to suckle until they are as old as 18 months Experts are still unsure about the fate of a subspecies of glossy black cockatoos that lives on the island Only about 300 to 370 of the birds remained before the fires O Gorman added that both humans and animals were facing decades long recoveries ,-1

people stepping up and shedding light on the matter but nature itself has started to send obvious and rather dire signals It is sad to say that 2019 has been the year of wildfires First it was the Amazonian wildfires claiming 2 240 000 acres of land Then the Californian wildfires Kincade being the largest one amounting to a total of 259 823 acres burnt And now the ongoing New South Wales bushfires in Australia with 8 895 794 acres of land destroyed and counting Image Credits Beyond Coal Gas Writer and historian Bodie Ashton took to Twitter to shed some perspective on the wildfire situation in NSW Australia His spot on comments and remarks have drawn the attention of thousands In just two days his tweet thread received over 133 000 likes and was retweeted over 72 000 times Ashton s straightforward explanation of the situation has reached hundreds of thousands of people The situation has gotten so out of hand that a country nearly 2 000 kilometers away New Zealand can

touch with the author of the tweet Bodie Ashton to provide some comments and his thoughts on the issue Dr Bodie Ashton is a historian in Lower Bavaria raised and educated in Adelaide South Australia He is also a researcher author lecturer editor and speaker who provides historical consultancy and lectures Wildfire containment and prevention seems to have always been problematic in Australia as explains Ashton Bushfires have always been a concern in Australia because of the generally very dry and hot conditions in the summer The fact that there are fires in summer is therefore an inevitability What is really concerning at the moment in Australia is the fact that the fires are so widespread continued Ashton They ve formed so early in the fire season and are so intense Ordinarily state fire services can rely on firefighters from other states to assist Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan It is hard to predict when the fires will be doused as it has become somewhat of a self reinforcing cycle In some places the fires have formed the right meteorological conditions to create their own lightning storms elaborated Ashton Lightning will spread the fires if it strikes dry fuel such as grassland bark and so on With that too comes the risk of the wind which not only changes the direction of the fire front but also can carry embers that will set fires kilometres away Bored Panda asked Dr Ashton to comment a bit on the political climate and possible aftermath of the bushfires He had this to say I think that if it s difficult to predict how the fires will develop it s more difficult to predict the political situation The Prime Minister Scott Morrison has made himself singularly unpopular within the electorate by seeming extremely out of touch going on holiday to Hawaii was probably the least egregious of his most recent missteps Dr Ashton continued The problem is not necessarily Morrison in and of himself though his party the Liberal National Party has assumed a very pro coal and anti climate science agenda which has been singled out for comment by among others Greta Thunberg Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan My position on climate change is quite clear I think the vast weight of scientific evidence speaks for itself elaborated Ashton while the LNP government holds an ideological stance contrary to that but to leave that disagreement aside for the moment this government and its predecessors have been warned for years by scientists from the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO as well as by numerous other experts that conditions in Australia are following a trend of becoming more conducive for earlier larger widespread more intense harder to control fires The fact that the government whatever its ideological position on the climate change issue is singularly unwilling even to entertain a discussion about it ignores the counsel of its own experts and instead relegates it to a purely political issue is a clear failure of leadership from a body tasked with safeguarding the wellbeing of the Australian people explained Dr Ashton his position Ashton continued I don t like trying to predict the future but if I were to gamble I d say that Morrison might well be finished as Prime Minister after this emergency passes but in that case it will probably be dealt with internally by the LNP understanding that he is now too unpopular with the Australian electorate to continue to function in the role In that case I fear that there will be some window dressing and some shuffling of ministerial portfolios but no significant change in who controls the levers of power Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan Image credits manwithoutatan Dr Ashton concluded the interview with the following When I wrote my thread it was not to claim any expertise there are fantastic people doing work on this but I m not one of them Instead I m a historian from Australia living in Germany and I ve come to realise that people couldn t really visualise what these fires are like on the ground I want people then to understand three things in particular continued Ashton Firstly I want them to think of Australia not as some far off place going through an emergency that affects only a small number of people Instead I want them to understand that this is a country where the fires in just one state if you lined them up in a row could stretch from London to Singapore Secondly I want them to know of the extraordinary bravery and heroism of Australian firefighters and volunteers It is only due to them that more people have not been killed in spite of the fact that they are woefully underfunded and ill equipped and many of them are faced with the possibility of extreme financial hardship because they can t work or can t fulfil their requirements for their unemployment payments Finally I want people to understand that this is something that affects us all It s very easy to sit back and think that this is a terrible disaster we can t do anything about But we can The fire services are accepting donations there are volunteer organizations that have been thrown together so that people who are being evacuated can find somewhere to sleep with host families even the act of sharing these things on social media might help to reach people who desperately need it Image credits Tatiana Gerus Bored Panda also reached out to Clay Weston a businessman and car enthusiast from Central Queensland Australia to comment on the wildfire issue from the perspective of a citizen living at the doorstep of a natural disaster Central Queensland is relatively unaffected by the tragedy happening in New South Wales and Victoria explained Weston We have had wildfires in Central Queensland but they were managed as best as the local emergency services could volunteers assisted and were utilized to the best of their training and resources A lot of people are blaming Australia s Prime Minister Scott Morrison for wildfire mismanagement Many criticize him for failing to make adequate preparations and precautionary measures as there is a lack of equipment to deal with the fires and for his economy over climate policies To top it all off people became enraged by the PM when he left for vacation to Hawaii effectively leaving everyone else to deal with the fires Image Credits European Union Modified Copernicus Sentinel Data Weston also said that wildfire prevention and management in Australia has been hectic for a while The fact that the forestry has been mismanaged for 20 years can be laid at successive state governments of both political persuasions No doubt in the aftermath there will still be differing opinions on why the fires are so big As of the moment of this article the wildfires are still ravaging New South Wales Nearly 8 9 million acres of land have been burned to the ground with over 1 300 reported homes lost to the fire and 15 deaths Haunting red skies are ever present hitting pollution levels equivalent to smoking a packet of cigarettes a day My friends from New South Wales tell me that there is up to 1 meter of debris fuel on the forest floor pointed out Weston Once that much fuel starts to combust it s almost impossible to stop in the rugged and inaccessible areas of those forests The combustion is inevitable as the fires are making their own weather at this point You can donate towards disaster relief and recovery efforts like the Red Cross and St Vincent de Paul Society to make a change and to help Australians affected by the bushfires Like what

listen to These fires are nothing to do with climate change This is arson and lack of bush management Greenies protested back burning so now we get out of control fires instead of controlled ones So the extra brush caused the heat to start as early as September then set itself on fire And the extra brush has secretly been chasing away sufficient rain for the past decade I m not pro or con backburning really and I know the build up of brush causes bigger fires This has happened in nature since before we existed without mankind needing to backburn small fires then a large one regrowth

saying it s the foods fault for being there If what you say is true this is an armageddon level crisis The PM seems to be both ignoring the problem and taunting his own constituency Talk about Nero fiddling while Rome burned Today on a visit to one of the affected areas he held out his hand to a firefighter who said no I don t want to shake your hand So he then leaned forward and grabbed the guy s hand and shook it anyway The firefighter got up and walked off which shows a great deal of restraint because I d have punched the asshole if he did that to me the guy said NO you don t grab him anyway He then went to an official and said please apologise to the firefighter but then went on to say he s probably just tired which implies despite the apology he still thinks the firefighter was in the wrong and needs excusing The official said No he just lost his house I d have decked that guy What is it about no means no that he doesn t understand His photo ops are an embarrassment when he forces himself on grieving people who only want answers Our PM turned up on a visit with a security convoy with multiple trucks to the bushfire hit areas He brought no water no first aid supplies no food all desperately needed by bushfire refugees who have nothing now He turned up to do a photo op of shaking hands People are angry The trucks Full of his personal security instead of aid This is all true I live in the middle of this right now The whole state of NSW has been declared a state of emergency right now Many towns have been completely evacuated by now Other towns are without food

A koala on a burnt tree Kangaroo Island Julie Fletcher WWF Australia The fires are out and we are now at a critical moment as we work to restore what Australia has lost The unprecedented fire season saw fires burning in every state and territory in the country but for the first time this fire season all fires have now been contained It has been a long and hard fight for our volunteer rural firefighters but the work they have done has been exceptional With the fires contained as a nation we re starting to assess what we have lost and begin the long road to recovery ahead At least 32 lives have been lost and over 2 700 homes lost WWF is greatly saddened by the loss of life and homes as well as all the injuries pain and suffering caused by the bushfires More than 12 million hectares of Australian land has been burnt When habitat is lost our wildlife suffers It s been estimated that around 1 25 billion animals have been killed across Australia to date This includes thousands of koalas and other iconic species such as kangaroos wallabies kookaburras cockatoos and honeyeaters burnt alive and many thousands more injured and homeless The catastrophic megafires that swept across our country have greatly exacerbated the species extinction crisis we re already facing That s why WWF Australia has called for immediate global support to establish a AUD 30 million Australian Wildlife and Nature Recovery Fund Whilst we still may not have the full picture yet we already know the WWF Australian Wildlife and Nature Recovery Fund will deliver Wildlife response

Wildfire Today News and opinion about wildland fire The results could lead to more accurate models for spotting and fire behavior Data collected in an Australian study could lead to the development of more accurate predictive models for wildfire behavior and spotting especially for extreme wildfires Burning embers driven ahead of a wildfire can dramatically increase the rate of spread and the danger faced by firefighters and the public Under moderate burning conditions a small number of spot fires might be suppressed if enough firefighting resources are available but on large plume dominated fires pushed by strong winds spot fires far from the main fire can burn together making suppression at the head of the fire impossible In many cases ember showers have been the primary ignition source for the destruction of structures in the wildland urban interface During the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in eucalpyt dominated forests in Australia the maximum spot fire distances were 30 to 35 km 18 to 22 miles and during the 1965 wildfires in eastern Victoria were 29 km 18 miles Spot fires in North America have been documented at distances of up to 19 km 12 miles A research paper on spotting distance in Victoria and New South Wales was published earlier this week by the International Journal of Wildland Fire written by Michael A Storey Owen F Price Jason J Sharples and Ross A Bradstock titled Drivers of long distance spotting during wildfires in south eastern Australia The researchers took advantage of the increasing use of airborne mapping technologies on wildfires in Australia including infrared and multispectral line scanning to analyze data from 338 observations See map above They used ArcGIS to manually draw polygons and determine the size of the actively burning areas of the fire which they called source fire area and measured the distance to spot fires and the size of each They also collected fuels weather and topography information Below is an excerpt from the research Maximum spot fire distances ranged from 5 0 m to 13 9 km mean 0 9 km 95th percentile 3 9 km The mean number of spot fires per source fire irrespective of distance was 13 The distribution of maximum distance values appeared exponential with a high proportion of shorter distances Fig 4a Very long distance spotting was rare only 11 source fires had a maximum spotting distance 5 km Eleven of the fires had spotting distances more than 5 km 3 1 miles The longest distance measured to a spot fire was 13 9 km 8 6 miles The analysis of 338 wildfire line scan observations found the size of the active area of the source fire to be the strongest predictor of long distance spotting Important secondary effects were fuel weather and topography Excerpts Wind speed was important to both Maximum distance and long distance Spot number Upper level wind speed had weaker but still significant effects in the models Wind at different levels can influence many aspects of wildfire behaviour including plume development plume turbulence and tilt fire intensity vorticity development firebrand transport and ignition likelihood in receiver fuels A steep slope somewhere within the source fire i e source fire max slope increased the maximum spot fire distance and the probability of spot fire occurrence 500 m TRI Terrain Ruggedness Index performed similarly but was highly correlated with slope 0 9 so was not included in the same models An area of relatively high wind exposure e g exposed ridge also increased maximum spotting distance Slope and wind exposure may be important through interactions with wind changing wind speed increasing turbulence and potentially enhancing pyroconvection leading to enhanced firebrand generation and transport W e did not find a commonly used measure of bark spotting potential to be a significant predictor Our results suggest that to accurately predict long distance spotting models must incorporate a measure of source fire area Gathering data on spotting and plume development at wildfires over a range of intensities including measuring intensity and frequent line scans and improving fuel maps should be prioritised to allow for the development of reliable predictive spotting models The fibrous or stringy bark on some eucalyptus species is particularly suited aerodynamically for being lofted in a convection column and traveling for long distances while still burning and is one of the primary ignition sources for long range spotting in Australia The bark on North American trees is different but the methods used by the Australian researchers could be used to collect similar spot fire occurrence data in the United States and Canada which could lead to improved spotting and fire behavior models The researchers found the climate models consistently underestimated the observed increase in temperatures in southeast Australia A group of scientists published a study that shows global warming led to warm and dry weather that created conditions favorable to large bushfires in Australia From the BBC Global warming boosted the risk of the hot dry weather that s likely to cause bushfires by at least 30 they say But the study suggests the figure is likely to be much greater It says that if global temperatures rise by 2C as seems likely such conditions would occur at least four times more often The analysis has been carried out by the World Weather Attribution consortium Co author Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt The Netherlands told the BBC even the study s very conservative estimates were troubling Last year the fire prevention system in Australia which is extremely well prepared for bushfires was straining It was at the limits of what it could handle with volunteers working for weeks on end said Prof van Oldenborgh As the world warms these events will become more likely and more common And it s not something that we are ready for During the 2019 2020 fire season in Australia record breaking temperatures and months of severe drought fueled a series of massive bushfires across the country At least 33 people were killed and more than 11 million hectares 110 000 sq km or 27 2 million acres of bush forest and parks across Australia burned Although it makes sense that human induced global warming is likely to have led to more bushfires assigning a figure to that increased risk is complex That is because other factors not directly related to climate change may also play a significant role These include increased water use making the land drier urban heating effects or unknown local factors Nevertheless Prof Jan van Oldenborgh and 17 fellow climate scientists from six countries gave it their best shot It was by far the most complex study we have undertaken he told the BBC The researchers found the climate models consistently underestimated the observed increase in temperatures in southeast Australia and so could not pinpoint a figure for the increased risk from climate change They were however able to tease out a minimum risk We show that climate change definitely increases the risk of the extreme weather that makes the catastrophic bush fires that south east Australia has experienced in the past few months more likely by at least 30 But we think it could be much more We don t know how much more It could be a lot more Prof van Oldenborgh is among those attempting to find out if the current climate computer models really are underestimating the influence of global warming and if they are working out how to correct them The findings will be due by the end of August 2020 The Governor General of Australia has appointed three commissioners to lead a royal commission to look into the bushfires that so far during the 2019 2020 fire season have devastated to an unprecedented extent large areas of Queensland New South Wales and Victoria From ABC Australia Two more commissioners former Federal Court judge Annabelle Bennett and leading environmental lawyer Andrew Macintosh will join former Australian Defence Force ADF chief Mark Binskin The trio are due to deliver their findings to the Federal Government by the end of August More than 30 people died across the country during the disaster and thousands of homes were destroyed The ABC revealed earlier this month that hazard reduction would form a key part of the inquiry after Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded an investigation into whether controlled burns and land clearing operations had been hampered across the country Climate change and specifically its effect of creating longer hotter and drier fire seasons will also be considered by the royal commission In January when a royal commission was being proposed the United Firefighters Union of Australia said there had already been numerous bushfire related inquiries over the past two decades One more commission would likely come up with the same issues they said The union believed there should be instead an audit all of the existing recommendations that haven t been implemented They said Royal Commissions are expensive can take hundreds of days force witnesses to relive the trauma and the commission has no binding power to implement recommendations A royal commission evaluated the Australian bushfires that occurred in February 2009 Public hearings began on April 20 2009 with the Commission hearing from 434 witnesses over 155 hearing days before concluding on May 27 2010 Witnesses included two expert panels and 100 lay witnesses drawn from bushfire affected communities Almost 1 700 written submissions were considered by the Commission close to 1 000 exhibits tendered and 20 500 pages of written transcripts produced Meanwhile New South Wales is conducting an independent expert inquiry into the 2019 2020 bushfire season Dave Owens APM former Deputy Commissioner of NSW Police and Professor Mary O Kane AC Independent Planning Commission Chair and former NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer are leading the six month inquiry which is reviewing the causes of preparation for and response to the 2019 20 bushfires The Inquiry welcomes submissions from bushfire affected residents emergency and support personnel organizations and the general public A large electronic billboard in New York s Times Square featured a video message this week thanking the firefighters from the United States and Australia that worked on the bushfires in Australia Angeles National Forest crew returns after 30 days Three more Incident Management Teams from the United States and Canada have deployed to Victoria Australia These teams will continue to support local crews in East Gippsland positioned in the regional Incident Control Centres and out on the fire ground The 20 person hand crew that left January 7 from the Angeles National Forest ANF in Southern California to assist with the bushfires in Australia returned 30 days later on February 5 I admit I am old school about some issues related to firefighting I could not help but notice a striking difference between the first photos of U S personnel en route down under compared to the more recent groups The early photos from December of the personnel from scattered locations around the Western U S looked like they could have been on their day off on the way to McDonalds But beginning in January the photos began to show what was obviously professionals on the way to an important assignment As they walked wearing their uniforms through the airport in Australia other travelers in the airport spontaneously applauded Very different from the early groups wearing sneakers jeans and a wide variety of t shirts in assorted colors I mentioned to Robert Garcia the Fire Chief for the ANF the difference in the appearance of the various groups of firefighters when they were traveling He said We honestly believe that how we show up is a key part of professionalism and as such their duty Despite many changes we are trying our best to hold to the professional core values of duty respect and integrity We insisted that they all depart and arrive in the FS uniform and although they are represented by all 5 ANF IHC crews ANF Engine crews prevention and aviation they all wore the USFS Angeles NF Nomex and T shirt Here is a link to more information about the crews from the U S working in Australia The article includes a couple of videos Below are photos of the ANF firefighters in more casual attire as they were working in Victoria but still wearing the ANF t shirts Huge tree in the

 Updated March 3 2020 Download this information as a PDF General Summary Status of Personnel Group 9a and several additional support personnel have returned from assignment in Australia U S personnelÂ currently assignedÂ to Australia 65 U S personnelÂ assigned to dateÂ to Australia 362 Personnel Currently Assigned Total U S Personnel Group 9b Victoria 40 Group 9c Victoria 20 Support Personnel Various 5 Total Currently Assigned 65 The United States has been sending U S Department of the Interior DOI and U S Forest Service USFS wildfire personnel to assist with ongoing suppression efforts as bushfires continue to burn in Australia Nearly 300 298 wildland personnel from the USFS and DOI were intermittently deployed from December through February based on requests from the Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council Those who were initially deployed have returned to the U S after completing 30 day assignments There are currently 137 personnel deployed to the states of New South Wales Victoria and South Australia While recent rain has reduced the immediate threat in some locations fire conditions continue to impact multiple communities The protracted fire season has created resource and fatigue management challenges for agencies Australia typically experiences fire season until as late as May The U S will likely continue to send personnel as requested Two task forces 20 person crews arrive in Melbourne on Feb 21 One additional 20 person crew is set to arrive on Feb 24 Firefighters from the U S are filling a variety of wildfire and aviation management roles including aircraft management planning operations fire behavior analysis fireline supervision chainsaw operations and other positions They are based in New South Wales and Victoria where most of the fire activity is occurring U S firefighters are generally given time to acclimate to their new surroundings and the new time zone on the day that they arrive They then receive operational and safety briefings from Australian fire authorities U S firefighters work closely with Australian firefighters once they have completed thorough briefings and a safety measure review Â The United States Australia and New Zealand have exchanged fire assistance for nearly 20 years The most recent exchange occurred in August 2018 when 138 Australian and New Zealand wildfire management personnel assisted with suppression efforts in Northern California and the Northwest For nearly 30 days they filled critical needs including mid level fireline management heavy equipment helicopter operations and structure protection during the peak of the western fire season The last time that firefighters from the United States were sent to Australia was in 2010 Â The ability to exchange firefighting resources with Australia is based on a bilateral agreement titled Arrangement between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior of the United States on the one side and Emergency Management Australia on the other Side Concerning the Exchange of Wildland Fire Management Resources which defines what type of assistance can be provided How the countries exchange resources is defined in the accompanying Operating Plan There is a similar agreement and operating plan between the United States and New Zealand The Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America entered into these agreements under the Emergency Wildfire Suppression Act as Amended U S Public Law 100 428 42 USC Section 1856m Link to Australian International Arrangement Under this agreement only federal employees from the United States are permitted to assist in Australia Legally the National Interagency Fire Center cannot mobilize non federal employees such as state and local firefighters to Australia Â Australia is very appreciative of the generous offers of support that they have received throughout this very challenging bushfire season from firefighting agencies throughout the United States Â All firefighting personnel needs are being met through existing agreements between Australia the United States Canada and New Zealand While entirely grateful for the offers to assist Australia has specifically stated that they cannot accept unsolicited wildland fire personnel or volunteers to assist with the fire response Wildland firefighting requires a very specific and coordinated response effort only those who are officially requested through the U S government should respond The best way to support fire affected communities and emergency service agencies is through financial donations that can be made directly to the emergency service agencies or established charities More than 6 000 registered charities are working in bushfire affected regions Please see this list of contact details for charities that can accept donations to support bushfire relief or recovery efforts This list has been provided by the Australian Treasury Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Charities and Not For Profits Commission and will be progressively updated The National Multi Agency Coordinating Group comprised of federal and state wildland fire representatives works with the National Interagency Coordination Center based at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise Idaho to mobilize resources and distribute Australian assistance requests across interagency partners Â Â The National Interagency Fire Center is coordinating with personnel in Australia to facilitate interviews with U S firefighters working there When feasible U S firefighters may be available for phone or skype interviews but please remember that they are working for the Australian government and their firefighting assignments must remain the top priority Please note the 15 18 hour time difference between the U S and Australia which is a day ahead of the U S and be respectful of limited interview opportunities For more information about the United States firefighter deployments please call the National Interagency Fire Center NIFC Fire Information Line at 208 387 5050 NIFC cannot provide statistics on the

Q The U S uses the term wildfire and Australia uses the term bushfire is there a difference between the two A These two terms are technically interchangeable Australia uses the term bushfire and the United States uses the term wildfire but they have similar meanings Both terms connotate an uncontrolled unplanned fire burning through vegetation Q Can contract and non federal fire personnel assist with the Australian bushfire response under the international agreement A No our international agreement only authorizes the sharing of federal employees Here is a link to the Australian International Arrangement https goo gl sFTkN8 Q Â Why isn t the U S sending airtankers to Australia A Australia has contracts with some of the same airtanker companies many of the airtankers that are on contract in the U S during the summer months are on contract in Australia for their peak months of activity Q Â Why isn t the U S sending equipment to Australia A Australia has adequate equipment capability and has not requested additional equipment We have sent qualified engine operators to augment staffing on their fire engines Q Â Why aren t we sending more people Â A Before resources are sent to Australia we must have an official request from the Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council AFAC Q I have wildland fire experience and I am ready to help Can NIFC send me to Australia A As much as Australia appreciates the generous offers of support all personnel needs are being met through existing agreements between Australia and the United States Canada and New Zealand No additional firefighters are needed The Australian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council AFAC Resource Sharing Centre is working with Emergency Management Australia to coordinate international and interstate bushfire emergency assistance All requests are processed in close consultation with the Australian states and territories to determine appropriate support options for fire affected communities Â The best way to support impacted communities and emergency service agencies is through financial donations These can be made directly to Australian emergency service agencies or established Australian charities More than 6 000 registered charities are working in bushfire affected regions This list provided by the Australian Treasury Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Charities and Not for profits Commission contains contact details for charities that are supporting bushfire relief or recovery efforts https www bushfirerecovery gov au offers help registered bushfire charities It will be progressively updated Q Is it common for the United States and Australia and New Zealand to support each other during respective fire seasons A The U S Australia and New Zealand have shared knowledge technical and operational wildland fire management support for more than 50 years This cooperation was defined in policy and support agreements in 2002 The U S and Australia have exchanged techniques policies and information since 1964 Prior to this series of mobilizations Australia has sent fire management specialists to the U S seven times since 2000 and the U S has sent fire personnel to Australia four times since 2003 Q What type of international agreement supports this type of assistance A The ability to exchange fire management resources with Australia and New Zealand is based on formal bilateral agreements entered into under the Emergency Wildfire Suppression Act as Amended U S Public Law 100 428 42 USC Section 1856m These arrangements have an accompanying Operating Plan which defines the process by which each country will exchange resources The first agreements were signed in 2002 even though the first exchange for firefighting support occurred in 2000 Link to the current Australian International Arrangement https goo gl sFTkN8 The agreements permit the exchange of federal wildland firefighters only they do not legally provide for the mobilization of state local or volunteer firefighters These are Â legally binding documents so NICC cannot send non federal employees to Australia or New Zealand Q Are there differences between Australia New Zealand and the U S in managing wildfires A Australia New Zealand and the United States share a common system for managing all types of emergency incidents including wildland fires In the United States this system is called the Incident Command System ICS in Australia and New Zealand it is known as the Australasian Inter Service Incident Management System AIIMS The three countries also share similar training and physical fitness requirements Firefighters are made aware of localized differences and terminology prior to their assignments Firefighters in Australia and New Zealand encounter some of the most challenging bushfires in the world Â They are highly skilled and able to meet many of the same challenges that U S firefighters face including wildland fires in urban interface areas difficult terrain fuels and weather conditions and integrating aerial and ground resources Q Will all of the U S firefighters be assigned to the same fire A Not necessarily They will be assigned according to their particular qualifications Some of the U S firefighters may work together on a particular incident and others may be assigned as single resources depending on the need Â All of them will work closely with the Australian firefighters and Australian fire authorities Q Who pays the cost for deploying U S firefighters to Australia A All reimbursable costs will be handled per the Operating Plan under the international agreement Salary travel lodging meals and other expenses normally covered by the U S will be reimbursed by the Australian government ,-1

This competition is now closed Devastating wildfires have spread across eight and a half million hectares of land in Australia How can we stop it from happening again By Bill McGuire On our overheating planet wildfire is now one of the most terrifying and costly of all natural disasters From California to Russia Australia to the UK and Greenland to the Amazon record temperatures and tinder box conditions have in recent years driven conflagrations that have taken hundreds of lives and immolated many thousands of properties in some cases entire communities Two years ago major burns in California resulted in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season ever recorded with more than eighty deaths and three quarters of a million hectares scorched at a cost of US 12 billion In 2019 it was the Brazilian Amazon that burned helped by fires started deliberately by farmers and loggers This year it is Australia s turn with the most widespread bushfires on record continuing to spread devastation death and despair As of mid January a staggering and unprecedented eight and a half million hectares of bush and forest has been turned to ash an area equal to the size of Austria and the cost is set to rise above five billion Australian dollars with months of the fire season still to go There are other costs too While the country s bush and eucalyptus forest is particularly resilient to fire and will soon recover its fauna is not The blazes may already have taken the lives of more than one billion animals which could have a long term impact on populations of at risk koalas and other vulnerable species Read more about wildfires Looking at images and film of the Australian fires it is easy to take away the impression that they are unstoppable that nothing can be done to limit their scale and the destruction they bring but this is not the case While battling great conflagrations once they are in full spate is almost a lost cause measures can be taken in advance to try and manage the occurrence of fires and to limit their potential to grow into the colossal blazes that are near impossible to control And such measures are nothing new In fact Australia s indigenous population has a long history of successfully managing fire across landscapes and ecologies that are tuned to living with it For thousands of years nomadic aboriginals played a key role in preventing conflagrations by burning surface vegetation to create firebreaks that constrained the scale of fires started naturally by lightning The fires were set during the cooler months so as to limit their reach leaving behind stretches of land cleared of the dry plant debris that fuels much larger conflagrations As their numbers dwindled however and their lifestyle was destroyed so too was this invaluable service Now however using such traditional practices to start so called controlled or hazard reduction burns are being taken seriously by stakeholders in the fire management business There have already been some small scale successes in managing bushfire activity most notably where traditional methods have been combined with modern technologies including satellite mapping and controlled aerial ignition using helicopters or drones And the ideas are catching on elsewhere too In Venezuela a combination of indigenous knowledge and modern techniques is being used to manage fires in the country s Canaima National Park while methods and strategies implemented in Australia are being exported to places as far afield as Botswana Brazil and Canada There are other things that can be done too in order to clamp down on wildfires and their impacts More sophisticated computer models are able to predict how a blaze will develop allowing better planning of fire fighting resources As urban centres expand into wildland areas where fires are more common the interface between the two becomes a critical zone where effective preventative strategies can help keep buildings safe These include maintaining a wide vegetation free zone around properties using fire resistant building materials and keeping gutters and decking free of burnable debris Injury and loss of life can be minimised by planning multiple evacuation routes in advance and by ensuring that there is always good access for fire fighting vehicles Even taken together however such mitigation methods amount to little more than a collective sticking plaster Looking ahead prospects in countries prone to burning look bleak Even armed with new models and methodologies in the continuing war against wildfires it is likely that stakeholders will be battling just to stay still As global heating accelerates unprecedented temperatures extreme drought conditions and failing water supplies will conspire to provide a perfect storm that will bring ever more devastating conflagrations In Australia 2019 was the hottest year on record and the driest for nearly 120 years Read more from Reality Check On top of this December saw more than three quarters of the country experiencing the worst fire weather conditions on record As the conflagrations continue to rampage through fully grown forest as well as bush it is worth noting that Australia is essentially a desert with a few green bits around the edge The bottom line is that it is hardly surprising that as conditions become hotter and drier these bits become crisped and burned by heat and fire leading to questions being asked about the country s long term future on an overheated world Whisper it but maybe at long last the recognition that the fate of Australia is at stake will knock some sense into the climate change deniers and obfuscators who govern the country so that they begin seriously to tackle emissions in line with what the science says

Matt Simon Today in the journal Nature Climate Change researchers are publishing a series of articles as a kind of postmortem of the Australian bushfires The series is both a diagnosis of what happened as flames swept across the continent and a call to action for researchers the world over Climate change is a crisis for people the natural world at large and for science itself In particular some of the research is making a staggering argument This season s bushfires were so catastrophic they caught modelers off guard way off guard The models not only hadn t predicted that bushfires of this magnitude could happen now they hadn t even predicted that bushfires of this magnitude could happen in the next 80 years This is perhaps one of the first really big cases where we ve seen the real world do something before we ve been able to have the capacity to model it properly says climate scientist Benjamin Sanderson of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder who cowrote a piece in the Nature Climate Change package This event was worse than anything in any of the models at any point in this century Only one of the models toward the end of the century started producing things of this magnitude A model does its best to accurately simulate how the world works by estimating how changes to dozens or even hundreds of variables could lead to different outcomes For example climate models simulate how much warming might result from a certain increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere Political models use data like polling numbers and historical voter turnout levels to predict a candidate s chances of winning Fire models use historical observations to make calculations like In the past this much vegetation at this level of dryness has led to this kind of bushfire By Katie M Palmer and Matt Simon Yet as the saying goes All models are wrong but some are useful Scientists only have access to so much data and there s just no way to fully represent the complexities of the real world Modeling fire is also exceedingly complex because there are a galaxy of factors that determine the behavior of a fire A model has to take into account for example how forests might be evolving when a world with more CO2 in the atmosphere might stimulate more tree growth It has to account for how plant communities might change perhaps some species will grow more abundant and others more rare And you ve got to account for how drought and rainfall might result in more or less brush to burn a wet year produces a lot of vegetation which when followed by a drought produces mountains of dried out fuel Fires are right at the end of a long sequence of models which have to be pieced together to get the right answer says Sanderson While it s easier to model some of the smaller changes that might affect an ecosystem it s harder to model scores of them all together and still produce an accurate result We have very comprehensive models of forests and the way that the trees will respond to a warmer climate he adds And we have very comprehensive models of the climate and models of fire tuned to individual regions We re not at a stage where we can put them all together and have confidence in the result Another problem Running models this complex requires supercomputers And that s not cheap which means scientists don t get to keep test running their models to fine tune them It takes huge amounts of energy and computation to run a single simulation says Sanderson We backed ourselves into a corner with climate science where our models are so computationally expensive we can t really afford to run them more than once As other researchers who contributed to the Nature Climate Change series point out the unprecedented scale of this season s bushfires and the drier and warmer conditions that exacerbated them are beyond normal parameters anyway The widespread and prolonged drought conditions over the last two years have caused the entire eastern Australian forest area to dry out to extreme levels such that all natural fire breaks e g moist gullies south facing slopes swamps have been eliminated and the entire landscape becomes one connected fuel array wrote Western Sydney University fire scientist Matthias Boer who penned one of the articles published today in an email to WIRED A study by researchers at the University of New South Wales is currently underway to decipher precisely how climate change affected these recent fires But this climate and fire scientists can say for sure Climate change is making droughts more intense and more frequent and on smaller time scales turning Australia s landscapes into tinder Simply put drier hotter windier weather makes wildfires worse and dry hot winds can desiccate a landscape turning it into pure bushfire fuel These altogether crispier conditions lead to an even more destructive fire which was exactly the case this year Australia s landscape is dominated by temperate broadleaf and mixed forests themselves dominated by eucalyptus trees Looking at the last 20 years of satellite data the median annual percentage of these forests that burned during past fires was 1 percent This fire season that figure was 21 percent All of that is adding up to another problem for scientists Studying climate change in general or its effect on bushfires specifically is becoming increasingly difficult University of Queensland conservation scientist James Watson for instance studies birds in Western Queensland Right now it s just accepted that we can t do fieldwork in summer anymore out there he says It s too hot it s too dangerous you just can t physically do it Fifteen years ago we could have done it quite easily Watson and Lauren Rickards who co leads the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology s Climate Change and Resilience research program wrote in Nature Climate Change about how Australian scientists are grappling with both climate change and the attendant superfires Ecosystems under long term observation have burned to the ground and bushfires have destroyed facilities and vehicles critical to research Other extreme weather has brought the assault from above Watson and Rickards note Last month a cataclysmic hailstorm damaged 65 greenhouses in Canberra destroying years worth of experiments Some of those devastatingly enough were testing crops resilience to climate change As we think about how climate change impacts are ricocheting through society we re starting to realize that these impacts are ricocheting through research projects and through research institutions says Rickards And she adds there is this urgent need for researchers to stop pretending that we re distant witnesses of climate change that were somehow isolated or immunized observers and recognize that we are being affected Modern science has spent centuries exhaustively cataloging a world that we thought we knew to be fairly consistent seasons come and go species migrate a particular Australian forest burns once every few decades But scientists now work in a world that is both more perilous and more chaotic Your research is going to be severely disrupted if you don t actually recognize the risks posed by extreme climate events by long term shifts in your research sites by the pressures that your research participants are under says Rickards We ve turned this world into a hothouse one that s overwhelming the predictive powers of both human and computer And Australia s conflagrations are but a taste of disasters to come WIRED is where tomorrow is realized It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation The WIRED conversation illuminates how technology is changing every aspect of our lives from culture to business science to design The breakthroughs and innovations that we uncover lead to new ways of thinking new connections and new industries More From WIRED Contact

Australia has deployed military planes and ships to provide aid as hundreds of wildfires rage across Australia forcing residents to flee and destroying homes The Australian Defense Force is sending ships to the Victoria town of Mallacoota on a two week supply mission and using helicopters to bring in more firefighters since roads were inaccessible according to the Associated Press AP On Tuesday thousands of people from the town on Australia s southeastern coast fled towards the water as a fire ripped through the area Photos of residents taking shelter on boats circulated on social media Seven people have died since Monday with fires tearing through communities in New South Wales and Victoria states according to the AP The dead include a volunteer firefighter who was killed near the New South Wales Victoria border when his truck was flipped over by what local authorities called a fire tornado In New South Wales where Sydney is located firefighters are battling more than 100 fires according to the state s Rural Fire Service Sydney s famed New Years Eve fireworks went ahead despite the fires A petition calling on the government to cancel the display and give the funds to firefighters and farmers instead got more than 280 000 signatures New South Wales Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said this wildfire season is the worst on record We ve seen extraordinary fire behavior he said Tuesday according to the AP What we really need is meaningful rain and we haven t got anything in the forecast at the moment that says we re going to get drought breaking or fire quenching rainfall More than 900 homes have been destroyed in the state according to New South Wales Rural Fire Service A fire tracker map maintained by researchers in Western Australia shows that they are also threatening areas around every major city in the country And although the weather cooled slightly in parts of Australia on Wednesday authorities warned that with several months of summer left the worst is not yet over We have three months of hot weather to come We do have a dynamic and a dangerous fire situation across the state Victoria Emergency Commissioner Andrew Crisp said according to the AP Australia experienced its hottest ever drought conditions in 2019 and the country has experienced record breaking heat over the past few weeks When you have very hot dry windy conditions if all of those things come together a fire can get quickly out of control Lesley Hughes with the environmental group Climate Council of Australia tells TIME As the climate is warming up we re getting more and more extreme hot days and currently of course Australia is in the grip of probably unprecedented heatwave conditions almost right across the continent Despite the bushfire crisis Australia s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has argued that there is no direct link between Australia s greenhouse gas emissions and the severity of the fires burning across the country However he acknowledged that climate change could be impacting bushfires Australia is one of the highest per capita emitters of carbon dioxide in the world according to Climate Analytics an advocacy group that tracks climate data On Wednesday bushfires burned in all directions outside of Sydney including a fire near the Blue Mountains which has already destroyed an area larger than the state of Rhode Island Severe and very high fire danger alerts have been issued for parts of New South Wales in eastern Australia for New Years Day New South Wales Bureau of Meteorology warned of strong winds People in Sydney posted photos this week of haze enveloping the city Haze from the fires was impacting places as far away as New Zealand according to Australia s Bureau of Meteorology Several major wildfires burning across Southern Australia on Wednesday Thousands of lightning strikes earlier this week sparked dozens of fires reports the Adelaide Advertiser Several wildfires are also burning in the state of Victoria where Melbourne Australia s second biggest city is located State authorities issued an emergency warning on Wednesday urging some residents of Sunbury a town about 25 miles northwest of Melbourne to leave as firefighters battled a blaze The Premier of Victoria posted a New Years message on Twitter wishing safety to those fighting the fires The climate scientist Hughes tells TIME that the widespread wildfire crisis has made climate change a reality for many Australians Certainly this summer these conditions the ongoing drought the heatwave and the fires are really bringing home to people that climate change is not some future hypothetical issue she says Peter Dunn a former commissioner for the Australian Capital Territory Emergency Services Authority and a member of advocacy group Emergency Leaders for Climate Action tells TIME that the wildfire crisis has fundamentally shifted the climate debate in Australia He and other climate change activists believe Morrison s position on the country s greenhouse gas emissions is hindering the government s ability to tackle the wildfire crisis Read More As Smoke From Bushfires Chokes Sydney Australian Prime Minister Dodges on Climate Change By not accepting the link between climate change and bushfires as fully as the government should we re not getting sufficiently prepared to cope with the problem Hughes says It s really really frustrating the ongoing intransigence of this federal Conservative government She s not the only Australian upset over government inaction Protests broke out at Morrison s office in December with demonstrators demanding action on climate change while others criticized Morrison for taking a vacation to Hawaii during the fire crisis The Prime Minister cut short his family holiday and apologized for the timing of his trip We ve had no leadership from the government whatsoever They ve been missing in action Dunn says Write to Amy Gunia at amy gunia time com

forests will not recover from the wildfires experts say PUBLISHED January 30 2020 Pungent and damp the so called tall wet forests of southeastern Australia are home to the tallest flowering plants on Earth Eucalyptus regnans the Latin name of the mountain ash means â ruler of the gum treesâ â which is fitting given these giants can reach more than 300 feet high Many of Australiaâ s gum trees particularly those in drier forest types are famously able to tolerate fire throwing out new buds and shoots within weeks of being engulfed in flames But even these tenacious species have their limits Old growth forests of the mountain ash and a related species the alpine ash are among the gum trees that are less tolerant of intense blazes In the state of Victoria these trees had already been severely depleted by logging and land clearing Now the bushfires that have burned more than 26 million acres of eastern Australia in recent months are putting the forests at even greater risk

NASA GLOBAL FOREST WATCH Some of the forests razed this year have experienced four bushfires in the past 25 years meaning theyâ ve had no chance to recover says David Lindenmayer an ecologist at the Australian National University in Canberra â They should be burning no more than every 75 to 125 years so thatâ s just an extraordinary change to fire regimes â he says â Mountain ash need to be about 15 to 30 years old before they can produce viable amounts of seed to replace themselves following fire â The loss of these dominant trees is a significant problem since they provide vital habitat for threatened animal species such as the sooty owl the giant burrowing frog and a fluffy arboreal marsupial called the greater glider Also find out how Australiaâ s fires can create big problems for freshwater supplies â The ecosystem has effectively collapsed itâ s transitioned into something else â more likely to be colonized by generalist weedy plants â says John Woinarski a conservation biologist at Charles Darwin University in Australiaâ s Northern Territory â Theyâ ll converge into less interesting less distinctive vegetation that supports fewer threatened plants and animals â As the world warms with climate change the situation in Australia reflects whatâ s happening in forests globallyâ from California and Canada to Brazil and Borneo Even forests made up of species that thrive on cycles of fire and regrowth are losing resilience in the face of wildfires that are escalating in frequency severity and extent According to research published earlier this month climate change is significantly increasing the risk of wildfires by stimulating hot and dry conditions and high risk weather Over the past 40 years the length of fire seasons has increased by 20 percent across more than a quarter of the worldâ s vegetated land surface California for instance suffered its worst ever wildfires in 2018 Record blazes also struck other places with arid Mediterranean type ecosystems such as Greece and Portugal Tropical rainforests are being hit too with recent satellite data showing an 11 year high in Amazon deforestation much of it through deliberately set fires for land clearing Even boreal forests and tundra are ignitingâ fires consumed many millions of acres of Alaska and Siberia in 2019 Hereâ s what Portugalâ s wildfires may teach us about how to live with mega fires â Places that people didnâ t think could burn are now burning â says Craig Allen an ecologist who studies the effect of climate change on forests at the U S Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center in Los Alamos New Mexico One of the things changing globally is that the air is getting warmer Allen says As air warms it holds more water drawing moisture out of the environment drying soils and stressing trees This makes ecosystems more flammable and trees more likely to be attacked by insects which increases the number of dead trees further exacerbating fire risk â Warming temperatures are making fuel more available and lengthening fire seasons â he says â The fire season in western North America is two to three months longer than 30 years ago â The number of years with severe wildfires is also increasing says Camille Stevens Rumann a scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who studies how ecosystems respond to disturbance â Whereas before maybe you had one a decade or even less frequently now weâ re seeing these large bad fires at least every other year â she says Last year was Australiaâ s driest and hottest in 120 years of record taking An unprecedented drought left forests tinder dry and poised to ignite in fires that started in September and peaked in late December burning great swathes of Queensland New South Wales and Victoria â The places burned will bear the marks of this year for centuries â says Joe Fontaine a fire ecologist at Murdoch University in Perth Western Australia â Drier forests which burn more readily will likely replace wet forests in many places â Similarly increasingly frequent and intense fires in North America are acting like a filter slowly pushing out dominant vegetation Allen says For more than a century forest management has largely suppressed fires in the regionâ s Ponderosa pine forests resulting in a huge increase in tree density But extreme weather is making fires harder to suppress and when they do blaze they are so intense they are killing â mother trees â which are vital for reseeding the next generation following fire â Ponderosa pine forests are perfectly suited to high frequency low intensity forest fires burning in grass and pine needles in the understory â he says â But if severe fires get into the canopy of the trees the pines donâ t tolerate that and die as mature individuals which donâ t regenerate â Surrounded by scorched trees Steve Bear Station Fire Reforestation Project leader with the U S Forest Service surveys the area where Ponderosa Pine seedlings were planted in the Station Fire burn area at Barley Flats in the Angeles National Forest Ponderosa pine seeds rarely disperse further than about 500 feet so when trees die theyâ re leaving huge gaps In some mountainous forests of western North America Allen says â weâ re getting a wholesale conversion from dominant conifer forestsâ spruces firs and pinesâ to areas with a larger proportion of grasses and shrubs â Where forests canâ t fully recover from fire the animal species that rely on those ecosystems will face increasing challenges Part of the problem is that species struggling through frequent fire events are often already stressed by other climate related impacts such as drought heatwaves and pest infestations Whether so called stacked disturbances are further compounding recovery is â a crucial and massively important questionâ to answer Fontaine says His team has been studying a fire tolerant shrub Banksia hookeriana from Western Australia which holds its seeds in a woody cone that only opens after fire Theyâ ve found that since the 1980s climate change has caused a 50 percent reduction in the number of seeds it produces Combine increasing fire intensity with climate change and the shrub is facing a Sisyphean fate â Numbers like this take climate change from theoretical to a slap in the face â Fontaine says This pattern spells bad news for many North American animal species that prefer old growth forests such as the spotted owl and the Canada lynx says Stevens Rumann Australiaâ s current bushfires have so far burned more than 80 percent of the habitat of about 50 threatened species The entire ranges of some have been obliterated such as the Kangaroo Island dunnart a shrew sized marsupial carnivore and the mountain trachymene a fire sensitive herb Losing these individual plants and animals from the landscape means we may also be losing important interactions between species which could have unforeseen impacts on ecosystem function and their ability to recover from fire In Portugal wildflowers appeared to burst back to life abundantly after fires but a study published last year found that species of moths that are vital for pollinating them were transporting just a fifth of the pollen they were carrying in unburnt areas spelling trouble for regeneration further down the line However not all species will dwindle as wildfires increase More than a century of fire suppression in North America had led to a decline in the black backed woodpecker which is camouflaged to blend in against burned trees An increase in fires is now seeing it bounce back Stevens Rumann says In Australia many predatorsâ such as monitor lizards some birds of prey and introduced cats and foxesâ actively seek out fire scars to hunt survivors that are left exposed in landscapes devoid of cover Other animals that thrive in post fire landscapes include the fire chaser beetles in the genus Melanophila which lay their eggs in freshly burnt wood where their larvae develop Even species that are relatively common can benefit following fire Stevens Rumann adds â If you open up that forest and there are abundant shrubs and grasses â we tend to see a resurgence of things like deer and elk â While bigger hotter wildfires are becoming an increasingly common reality experts agree that the situation isnâ t entirely hopeless We need to be more ambitious creative and adventurous in our approach to conservation in a world where environmental disasters are more pervasive says Woinarski â It s a major challenge and â we won t have all of the solutions in the short term â Post fire seeding for example happens often in North America but is rare in Australia Lindenmayer says that dropping mountain ash seeds from helicopters may be something they consider in the future Planting forests with non native fire resistant vegetation is a more radical idea And better land management is another part of the solution â Thereâ s this great Finnish proverb that says Fire is a good servant but a bad master â notes Stevens Rumann alluding to the fact that humans can use fire effectively as a tool as long as it stays under our control Hereâ s how California is turning to natural solutions to manage wildfires For tens of thousands of years Aboriginal people in Australia effectively prevented large blazes by reducing fuel such as dry grasses and leaf litter with frequent small hand set burns Now there are increasing calls for a return to that kind of traditional burning â We suppress 98 percent of fires that start in the U S meaning that itâ s only those 2 percent that make the news or are large â says Stevens Rumann â But if we use more of that 98 percent to actually help clear high fuel loads and create a more mosaic landscape we have the potential to stop the spread of those large extreme fires â Nevertheless the climate change trajectory we are on will mean an unavoidable increase in droughts heatwaves and other drivers of fire Several decades from now 2019 may be regarded as normal year or even a relatively cool and wet year Allen says â Itâ s a really foreboding future that has crept up on us very quickly â Woinarski adds â Weâ re witnessing the beginning of the deterioration of many of our most loved ecological systems That s a tragedy for us but a worse tragedy for our descendants â

In the midst of the unprecedented wildfire devastation in Australia an unfathomable wildlife catastrophe occurred The fires overtook 27 million acres of landscape and with it the animals that live there Scientists estimate more than a billion individual animals have been lost on the Australian continent during the 2019 2020 bushfire season We re talking about not thousands of animals not hundreds of thousands of animals not millions of animals but billions of native animals lost said Chief Photographer of the Sydney Morning Herald Nick Moir The unique and rich biodiversity of Australia is unmatched worldwide Many of the animals in the path of the expansive bushfires exist nowhere else in the world So that means that Australia has an enormous custodial role to protect the biodiversity that s here Not only for the nation itself but for the rest of the planet said David Lindenmeyer an ecologist at Australia National University Climate Science Communicator David Holmes of Monash University echoes Lindenmeyer s concern So you ve got this beautiful ecology in Australia that s just millions of years old Holmes said That so many types of animals have been destroyed In some cases there s been extinction events already and it remains to be seen just exactly what that is going to do for our sense of identity in Australia Two of Australia s unique animals the koala and the kangaroo are beloved cultural icons for the country They are also two of the hardest hit by the unprecedented blazes Kangaroo Island is a celebrated wildlife sanctuary and tourism hot spot situated just off the coast of Adelaide Australia The island was left unrecognizable and an estimated 30 000 kangaroos and 50 000 koalas died On New Year s Eve blazes ripped across the south coast of Australia where Rae Harvey runs the Wild 2 Free Kangaroo Sanctuary Harvey has dedicated her life to the marsupial so much so that she stayed at the property until the flames were at her doorstep The fire blasted through the sanctuary burned her home down and threatened her life Eventually Harvey was forced to flee by boat and watch as the peninsula that she and her kangaroos called home was engulfed in fire I m only here for the animals many other wildlife carers down here feel like it s their responsibility to keep them alive I thought they were all going to be dead Every single one I didn t expect even one survivor Harvey said Much to her surprise there were many survivors Most of the returning kangaroos had injuries and the dedicated wildlife carer is again helping the animals rebound Harvey s dedication is unwavering I m only here for them she said It would be easy to walk away from all of this So now it s my job and many other wildlife carers down here feel like it s their responsibility to keep them alive Nick de Vos of Taronga Zoo in Sydney is one of the many people who have pitched in to care for koalas rescued from scorched areas It s devastating obviously to see it in masses like that and trying to work out how they can come back from this de Vos said It s not just mosaic burns It s like mass burns through crucial habitats so it is quite dire The 12 koalas being cared for by de Vos and the rest of the team are disease free making them genetically significant to the future of the species With an unexpected break in the fires scientists and researchers were able to track the location of the group of koalas and ensure their safety from the fires These koalas will eventually be released back into the wild The impacts on the koala population aren t short lived The koala before drought before the fires was already a species of challenge de Vos said There was potential that koalas could become extinct in the next 30 years with current land clearing regimes and habitat destruction that s going on So these bushfires have really just elevated that Any animals that have survived the fire now face the challenge of combating invasive species and surviving on a limited food supply So a koala lives in eucalyptus trees and it feeds on the leaves from those trees so when they burn that means that their habitat is limited and the food is even worse de Vos said Expanding metropolitan areas and development threaten koalas as well With less land to choose from a population bottleneck is caused by more of the animals packed into smaller areas So then when a fire goes through instead of taking a small portion of a population out it takes a large number out So it basically makes it tenfold the issue de Vos said The ultimate threat to the kangaroos koalas and many of the world s animals comes in the form of climate change This wasn t an ordinary fire This was a climate change disaster and a tornado Harvey said emotionally When asked what climate change means for the koala populations de Vos stresses that it doesn t look great if things continue the way they are Drought for a koala isn t great It means they need to access low lying trees in gullies and things so it restricts their habitat quite significantly he added Throughout history plants and animals have evolved to combat a changing environment The difference in modern times is the speed at which the environment is changing Over the years every plant and animal has adapted to its environment and if it slowly changes they will also slowly adapt to it It s when they quickly change then they don t have time to adapt and you could lose species just like that forestry expert Chris Brack explained We ve seen animals that are already extinct because of the changing climate Lindenmeyer said Average global temperatures have warmed by 1 so far A 2019 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlights some of the impacts to biodiversity and ecosystems with 1 5 of warming Of the 105 000 studied species 8 of plants 6 of insects and 4 of vertebrates would see their geographical range reduced by more than half ultimately changing our pollinating process with trickle down effects for agriculture Plants and animals used to think spring was safe It was wet lots of food around It s when you build your nest have your babies Babies can t cope with fire Fire comes in the spring Suddenly their entire population disappears That entire generation is burnt out Brack said South Florida is really ground zero in the United States when it comes to climate change The future of South Florida plant and animal species isn t much different than Australia s South Florida is actually a mirror of that when you look at us Zoo Miami s Ron Magill said South Florida is really ground zero in the United States when it comes to climate change and what climate change can do to this incredible place that we live in While the animals of Australia face the danger from fire the biggest threat to South Florida s wildlife stems from water Sea level rise This is something that s probably the single most catastrophic potential here in the state of Florida Magill said One foot sea level rise will wipe out half of the habitat where most of the animals live in the Everglades One of the most obvious examples of this is the Key Deer Here s an animal that lives basically on a key that s only a few feet above sea level One foot rise in sea level could wipe out the entire population of key deer The wildlife disaster happening in Australia is just one of the warning signs to the rest of the world with numerous lessons to be learned Protect your animals Don t let progress get in the way of nature Nature s really important And protect it with everything you ve got Because this was called the nature coast Now it s gone Don t let yours go Because we ve lost ours And I m heartbroken Harvey said through her tears ,2020-02-26T19:06:54-04:00

Australian officials have declared a new state of emergency as wildfires ravage the southeastern part of the country tearing through koala habitats and dense neighborhoods in a region popular with foreign tourists Various fires have devastated the states of New South Wales and Victoria since November tearing across more than 10 million acres destroying more than 1 000 homes and killing at least 18 people The state of emergency is the third in as many months Here are five things to know about the deadly blazes The fires were started by lightning The government has blamed a lightning storm for sparking nearly 200 wildfires earlier this week But conditions were exacerbated by other unusual weather including extreme winds heat and drought Temperatures in Australia have been high even for the summer soaring above 100 degrees in some parts of the country over the weekend just days before Australia recorded its hottest year on record Intense winds have not only helped the fires spread they have led to loss of life In New South Wales a fire engine was flipped over by high winds killing a 28 year old volunteer firefighter A severe drought has also played a key role Last year was the country s driest ever Experts say climate change is a factor Experts say climate change has exacerbated the fires Australians need only wake up in the morning turn on the television read the newspaper or look out the window to see what is increasingly obvious to many for Australia dangerous climate change is already here Penn State University professor Michael Mann wrote in The Guardian this week His comments follow a 2018 government report saying Australia s changing climate could result in natural hazards occurring at an unimagined scale The following year a United Nations report said Australia was one of the developed countries most susceptible to climate change More recently former New South Wales Fire and Rescue Commissioner Greg Mullins wrote in a November opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald that the blazes were burning in places and at intensities never before experienced He blamed an established long term trend driven by a warming drying climate In an interview with The Hill Stanford University climate professor Noah Diffenbaugh said the high temperatures are drying out vegetation increasing the risk of wildfires The long term warming has increased the frequency and severity of severe heat across the world he said When low precipitation conditions do occur they re more likely to co occur with high temperature and that combination elevates wildfire risk And that is exactly what we re seeing in Australia right now University of California Los Angeles geography professor Glen MacDonald added that higher temperatures also contribute to a longer fire season Particularly in Southeastern Australia that s definitely been part of it he told The Hill The death toll is rising People have been killed gone missing or been displaced because of the fires In this week alone at least seven people have been reported dead and two were reported missing in New South Wales In Victoria one person died This season at least 1 298 homes have been destroyed according to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Thousands of people have been evacuated from the most affected areas while tens of thousands elsewhere were left without power In the coastal town of Mallacoota some 4 000 people headed to the beach to escape the fire only to be stranded on the shoreline after being cut off by the blaze The government has since sent a Navy ship to carry people out in batches of about 800 at a time The fires show the potential to wipe out species Australia s koala population has been one of the hardest hit by the fires with government officials estimating 30 percent may have died in the blazes Up to 30 percent of the koalas in the region may have been killed because up to 30 percent of their habitat has been destroyed Australia s Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley told the Australian Broadcasting Corp last week But it s not just koalas that face a serious threat Researchers from the University of Sydney estimated some 480 million animals in New South Wales face death or displacement because of the fires The fires show threatened and endangered species are increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters that threaten to erase entire species The Puerto Rican parrot population has been hit hard by several record breaking hurricanes most recently Hurricane Maria in 2017 Scientists worry rising sea levels could harm oysters and mussels that rely on water that isn t too highly salinic Koalas are already facing habitat destruction from growing urban areas but the massive fires have wiped out even more territory Experts say restoring that habitat will be key to giving the species a chance to rebound Habitat protection is not just drawing a line around the minimal habitat needed for the species but making sure they can grow into areas that are protected said Sarah Uhlemann international program director at the Center for Biological Diversity These fires are just an ongoing example of what fires can do not only to people but the wildlife we care about Calls for stronger government response put spotlight on coal industry How to tackle this blaze and future ones has taken a decidedly political tone in Australia with some calling for more action from government leaders One area of tension has been Australia s reliance on coal an industry that employs tens of thousands of people Prime Minister Scott Morrison last month rejected calls to impose new restrictions on the coal industry saying What we won t do is engage in reckless and job destroying and economy crunching target Richard Di Natale who heads the Australian Greens political party accused Morrison of failing in his basic duty to keep our citizens safe from harm through his inadequate response to these fires and his refusal to accept that burning climate changing fossil fuels would lead to more frequent and intense bushfires He also called on Morrison to declare a Royal Commission into the bushfire crisis In November Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack called Di Natale and others inner city raving lunatics Morrison who heads Australia s Liberal Party was heckled this week when visiting a town affected by the fires How come we only had four trucks to defend our town Because our town doesn t have a lot of money but we have hearts of gold prime minister one woman reportedly said There have also been calls to redirect funds toward fighting the fire A petition that garnered nearly 300 000 signatures called for money spent on New Year s Eve fireworks to instead go toward combating the fires We need to fundamentally re think how we prepared for finance and respond to disasters like this Nicholas Aberle the campaigns manager for Environment Victoria said in an email to The Hill The existing approaches are no longer adequate to deal with the scale of bushfires Australia now faces nor the increasing scale of fires we will face in future For example it is hard to rely on shared equipment across states when every state is on fire simultaneously Aberle added that the country s government has been brought kicking and screaming to engage with the fires in any meaningful way because they know that climate change is making bushfires worse and they know in their heart of hearts that Australia is woefully behind the pack when it comes to cutting emissions View the discussion thread The Hill 1625 K Street NW Suite 900

Beanie Babies were a hot commodity in the 1990s People spent millions on the pellet filled toys at their peak and some even went as far as to forge checks and burgle toy distributors to fill out their collections So called Beanie Mania was driven by the idea that the stuffed animals would grow in value over time a gamble that led to disappointment for many owners But while the majority of Beanie Babies sold decades ago aren t worth much money today a select few are worth a small fortune I have clients spending up to 10 000 on them Dr Lori Verderame an antiques appraiser with an expertise in Beanie Babies tells Mental Floss Before you list your childhood toys on eBay it helps to know if you re sitting on a gold mine or thrift store material We spoke with Dr Lori about what to look for after taking your Beanie Baby collection out of storage and how to potentially make some money from it Beanie Baby collectors and appraisers have their own language When researching what makes certain toys valuable it helps to be familiar with these terms so you can apply them to objects in your own collection For instance certain errors or variations of the heart shaped tag on a Beanie Baby s ear could dictate its worth Experts refer to this as the hang tag the swing tag or just the ear tag The looped fabric tag stitched to the Beanie Baby s bottom end is known as the tush tag and it can also contain errors that may increase your doll s value The beans inside a Beanie Baby are called pellets They come in two types polyethylene PE pellets and polyvinylchloride PVC pellets with PVC being the rarer of the variations Many of the most valuable Beanie Babies today have some sort of error either on the tags or on the doll itself The rarity of these errors can make an otherwise worthless toy extremely valuable to collectors but this isn t always the case People are surprised to learn that errors are in fact very common Dr Lori says They will say well mine has an error so that must be rare They don t look at enough Beanie Babies to realize that many of them have errors If you find a misprint on a Beanie Baby tag or some other manufacturing mistake do some research before getting your hopes up Some Valentino bears had up to four manufacturing errors including brown noses instead of black ones and tag typos and that place them among the most sought after Beanie Babies today You may have a rare type of Beanie Baby from the early 1990s with a mint condition ear tag but if it smells like your basement you ll have a hard time selling it Mold mildew and cigarette smoke can all taint your Beanie Babies with hard to remove scents To prevent this Dr Lori recommends moving them out of their cardboard boxes and storing them in plastic containers Make sure you re keeping them in plastic tubs or even plastic Ziploc bags in order to keep any kind of dirt or damage away from them And if you re a buyer the importance of odor is a good reason to avoid purchasing vintage Beanie Babies online that you can t see or touch first When appraising Beanie Baby collections Dr Lori looks for nine toys in particular These are the original nine or the first ever Beanie Babies produced in small batches in late 1993 They include Patti the platypus Spot the dog Squealer the pig Brownie the bear Chocolate the moose Pinchers the lobster Splash the killer whale Legs the frog and Flash the dolphin Even without errors one of these Beanie Babies will almost always get the attention of toy collectors if it s in good condition Though you can look up how much certain Beanie Babies have sold for in the past that doesn t mean every toy like it is worth the same amount Price guides may claim to know how much every type of Beanie Baby is worth but these estimations are far from precise If you want to know how much an individual item could be worth you need to have it examined by an expert A Beanie Baby appraiser can not only tell you if your toy is worth selling but they can help you identify the type of buyer who will be willing to pay the most for it Some Beanie Babies need to be properly marketed in certain ways Dr Lori says Do you want to market to toy collectors market to the folks who are only collecting rare Beanie Babies or do you want to market to someone who says I ve lost this childhood toy There are so many collectors who are still actively collecting them even 30 years past the 1990s when they were at their height A legitimate appraiser can help you sell your Beanie Baby but not everyone claiming to be an expert online should be trusted A major red flag is when someone asks you to ship your Beanie Baby to them in order to get it evaluated You should never send your object away to anybody for any reason Dr Lori says People send them away and never see the object again Scammers say Oh I lost it It never got here No expert who is worth their weight will ever want your object The same goes for potential buyers who haven t put any money down on your item yet A much safer way to get a toy evaluated is to do it through a video call Many professional appraisers are willing to do this and it s still an accurate way to gauge your Beanie Baby s worth compared to showing it to someone in person ,-1
NRL round two will go ahead but bosses say the game faces an unprecedented challenge and have called for government assistance Sydney s annual Vivid Festival has been cancelled in an effort to help stop the spread of coronavirus Share ABC Science By Joel Werner and science reporter Suzannah Lyons for Sum of All Parts Share Can numbers help give us a sense of the unprecedented scale of this fire season Supplied Markus Dirnberger Many Australians just lost their summer thanks to the recent bushfire crisis These intense fires devastated communities destroyed wildlife populations and left many feeling bereft and overwhelmed To convey a sense of the unprecedented scale of the disaster much of the reporting focused on numbers but where did these figures come from Here we take a close up look at five of these numbers where they come from and whether they re for real Share In New South Wales alone more than 5 4 million hectares has been burned ABC Science Joel Werner The most obvious way to communicate the scale of a fire disaster and compare it to other fires is by focusing on the area of land the fire that has burned According to the Department of Home Affairs to date more than 12 6 million hectares across Australia have been burned To put that in some perspective in New South Wales alone more than 5 4 million hectares have been burned said Ben Shepherd from the NSW Rural Fire Service An average fire season here in New South Wales is typically at around 300 000 hectares Inspector Shepherd said So it has been extraordinary it has been unprecedented and hopefully it s one

of reasons obviously yes to give us a historical figure of how much area is lost but also that information once it is mapped goes into our systems here and allows us to better manage fires Inspector Shepherd said Depending on the size of the fire this mapping can be done by the firefighters on the ground observers in helicopters or by heat sensing aircraft that take a thermal image of the fire at a particular point in time That collected data then all gets sent back to the RFS headquarters and from there it is shared far and wide Whatever you can see on the Fires Near Me site is what we re looking at here Inspector Shepherd said All the information collected about a fire is used to check double check and triple check that the fire map is as accurate as possible Because if a fire s coming your way these maps may be used to make what can be life or death decisions Share Satellites can provide real time observations of active fires Joshua Stevens NASA EOSDIS LANCE GIBS Worldview From the beginning of September 2019 to February 23 2020 the Australian bushfires emitted 434 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere This equated to over three quarters of the 532 million tonnes Australian industry emitted in 2018 19 That number has been calculated by senior scientist Mark Parrington from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service CAMS in England which is the European Union s Earth Observation Program It uses a network of satellites called the Sentinels which among other things tracks all varieties of air pollution We re taking information on pollution sources around the world but also we re using real time observations from satellites of active fires Dr Parrington said From those observations of active fires we can estimate the emissions and we can feed them into our air pollution forecasting On the satellites NASA sensors called MODIS which stands for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer looks for heat sources on the Earth s surface with a much higher temperature than the surrounding land To calculate bushfire intensity you remove extraneous heat sources like volcanoes and gas flares and you re left with a measurement called the fire radiative power There s been a lot of work in the scientific literature in the past which have found relationships between the fire radiative power and how much vegetation is consumed by a fire Dr Parrington said You then estimate how much carbon dioxide or the carbon gases particulate matter and all the other pollutants related to fire are emitted Amazingly for Australia as a whole it hasn t been a record year fire activity wise Dr Parrington said But the New South Wales and Victorian fires in late December and early January emitted several times more carbon dioxide than the totals estimated for all the other years that CAMS has on record Share Smoke and hazardous air quality has affected many people living on the east coast of Australia AAP Dean Lewins Another bushfire pollutant has arguably had a more immediate and visceral impact on many people living up and down the east coast of Australia Obviously one of the big differences with this fire season is the number of large and medium sized cities and regional towns which had multiple days of hazardous air quality said economist Nicholas Biddle Professor Biddle from the Australian National University ANU was the lead researcher of a poll conducted in January 2020 which found 11 3 million Australian adults or 57 per cent of the Australian adult population were physically affected by smoke from the bushfires The poll is based on interviews with a representative sample of 3249 Australian adults whose responses could then be extrapolated to give estimates for the whole adult population The effects of the smoke would have varied in severity So you would have some people who had to close the doors to people who would have been hospitalised due to the very hazardous smoke levels Professor Biddle said Share Australians were more likely to be worried over concern for others safety than their own ABC News The ANU poll also estimated that 10 6 million or over half of Australian adults were anxious or worried for the safety of themselves their close family or their friends due to the bushfire crisis Professor Biddle said people were more likely to be worried or anxious when a family member or friend rather than themselves was being threatened by fire That makes sense because it s that uncertainty and not knowing what s occurring or what s likely to happen The poll also found that people worried about themselves friends or family were also more likely to have been exposed to other fire impacts These included having friends or family whose property was either threatened or damaged having their own property threatened being advised to evacuate having their travel or holiday plans affected or being exposed to smoke Share It s estimated that 1 billion animals have been killed in the fires but the real number is likely to be far higher Supplied M Fillinger One of the most sobering numbers is that 33 people died in this summer s bushfire crisis But next to this loss of human life perhaps the most emotionally impactful statistic is that over 1 billion animals were killed in the fires according to ecologist Chris Dickman of the University of Sydney WCMS pluginCache add lightbox 40 lightbox id lightbox 40 Want even more science health and tech Join the conversation on Facebook To come up with that number Professor Dickman and his colleagues looked at the published scientific literature and any other data they could find to estimate the average density of different groups of mammals birds and reptiles in New South Wales They then multiplied these estimates by the area burned to get the number of animals affected The first time I did that when 3 million hectares of forest and woodland estate had burned the number came out to around 480 million Professor Dickman said With the fire extent spreading by the end of December early January the figure went up to 800 million for New South Wales alone With parts of East Gippsland also on fire Professor Dickman and his colleagues thought it was reasonable to extrapolate the densities from New South Wales into the adjacent Victorian habitats If you do that you end up with an area burned of about 6 25 million hectares which equates to over 1 billion animals in the path of the fires he said But this number is clearly an underestimate Professor Dickman added because we know that across Australia more than 12 6 million hectares has been burned The estimate includes birds reptiles and terrestrial mammals but doesn t include bats frogs or fish because there weren t any density estimates available for them Then if you expand it to include invertebrates as many as 240 billion have been incinerated by the fires in just New South Wales and Victoria alone Professor Dickman said So yes a billion sounds a big

President and Fellows of Harvard College Powered by WordPress com VIP A massive plume of smoke rises from wildfires burning in Gippsland Australia AP file photo By Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer DateJanuary 27 2020January 31 2020 The recent massive wildfires in Australia have killed more than 30 people and an estimated 1 billion animals and burned 2 500 homes and millions of acres And the human toll is expected to rise even after the blazes wind down According to Harvard scientist Loretta Mickley senior research fellow in atmospheric chemistry at the Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering SEAS long term exposure to the smoke filled air hanging over much of the country could lead to many premature deaths in Australia In 2015 Mickley and a team of experts estimated that the air polluted by large forest fires in Indonesia had caused more than 100 000 premature deaths in that region The air quality across a large area of Australia has been very poor over a sustained amount of time and the net health effects could last for several months to a year said Mickley who spoke with the Gazette about her research GAZETTE What are the short term versus the long term effects of exposure to this kind of smoke MICKLEY We do see acute health effects from fires For example someone may have an asthma attack from high levels of smoke in her neighborhood or we might see an increase in hospital admissions for lung complaints or similar conditions But what people don t always realize is that the particles in the smoke can affect chronic conditions like heart or pulmonary diseases and the current thinking is that the long term health effects can be quite severe over a period of a year or even more So someone may get a stroke next June in that region and not realize that it can be traced back to smoke exposure I think that effect has not been widely reported with the fires in Australia GAZETTE Can you talk about the findings from your earlier work around fires and health outcomes and if they might apply here MICKLEY A few years ago we did a big project involving researchers from SEAS the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and fire experts at Columbia University Our team led by Harvard principal research scientist Sam Myers wanted to know about fires in Equatorial Asia mainly in Indonesia where they have periodic strong smoke events lasting weeks In that part of the world many fires are deliberately set to clear the tropical forests in order to plant oil palm or other trees that are valuable in the marketplace Farmers also use fire to reduce pests and clear debris in agricultural fields In very dry years which come periodically these fires can get out of control they escape and the smoke can linger over a broad area for weeks at a time And 2015 was particularly bad with very heavy smoke comparable I would say to what at least some areas of southern Australia are experiencing now Our team determined that the smoke that people in Equatorial Asia experienced in 2015 led to 100 000 premature deaths with most of those deaths occurring in the one year aftermath of the fires In 2015 Loretta Mickley and a team of experts studied the effects of large forest fires in Indonesia Photo by Eliza Grinnell GAZETTE Was there a main condition or disease that contributed to those deaths MICKLEY For our study we relied on well known well established relationships between particulate matter and health outcomes that people have developed over the years through long term monitoring The main diseases linked to particulate pollution are cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes followed by pulmonary disease and in kids pneumonia At first glance it looks like the levels of pollution experienced by some Australians because of the recent fires may be on par with what we saw in some areas of Equatorial Asia in 2015 We have not yet done any quantitative analysis though And Australia is much less densely populated than Equatorial Asia so we would expect fewer deaths GAZETTE In your research did you find there was a particular length of time someone needed to be exposed to this kind of poor air to suffer the long term health effects MICKLEY The longer you are exposed the more likely you are to get a health impact In Equatorial Asia the smoke lasted for weeks In our study we averaged exposure over the year to determine the health impacts over the following year GAZETTE How long does it take the air to clear from these kinds of events MICKLEY That s a good question For much of the world air quality returns within days to normal conditions because the wind will carry away the plumes and the fire is dead However if there is peat in the soil which you often see in tropical forests that peat can smolder for weeks So in these areas the fires need not just to be controlled but actually extinguished Then the smoke will die down pretty quickly GAZETTE Do you think these fires in Australia foreshadow the kinds of fires we could see in this country in the future MICKLEY Yes I do If you look at the history Australia and other areas like the western U S have gone through large climate changes in the past maybe 500 to several thousand years ago These are what we will call natural variations in climate sometimes accompanied by very severe droughts I was recently looking at records of charcoal in lake sediment which are made by bringing up cores of dirt from the bottom of a lake These records provide a sense of when fires occurred because you can see layers of charcoal indicating that there was regional fire at that time In lake sediment from Tasmania an island state off of Australia s southern coast it looks like there was tremendous fire activity occurring periodically over the last 2 400 years But the authors of the paper examining these records stress that just because intense fire activity comes naturally from time to time human caused climate change could also bring back some of these same conditions experienced in the past But this time there may be no return to normal conditions at least not for a long time That is as we pump more carbon dioxide into the air and temperatures rise some regions particularly Australia are expected to get much drier and these weather conditions will likely persist Carbon dioxide lasts a very long time in the atmosphere centuries so things don t look good The increase in temperatures alone evaporates the moisture in the soils Combine that with a drought and you have even drier conditions This dryness turns the vegetation into a fuel that can feed the fires very well as we ve seen As California fights devastating Camp Fire Harvard s Joe Allen

Australia is being ravaged by the worst wildfires seen in decades with large swathes of the country devastated since the fire season began in late July 27 people have died nationwide and in the state of New South Wales NSW alone more than 2 000 homes have been destroyed or damaged State and federal authorities are struggling to contain the massive blazes even with firefighting assistance from other countries including the United States All this has been exacerbated by persistent heat and drought and many point to climate change as a factor making natural disasters go from bad to worse There have been fires in every Australian state but New South Wales has been hardest hit Blazes have torn through bushland wooded areas and national parks like the Blue Mountains Some of Australia s largest cities have also been affected including Melbourne and Sydney where fires have damaged homes in the outer suburbs and thick plumes of smoke have blanketed the urban center Earlier in December the smoke was so bad in Sydney that air quality measured 11 times the hazardous level The fires range in area from small blazes isolated buildings or part of a neighborhood to massive infernos that occupy entire hectares of land Some start and are contained in a matter of days but the biggest blazes have been burning for months In NSW alone more than 100 fires are still burning Each year there is a fire season during the Australian summer with hot dry weather making it easy for blazes to start and spread Natural causes are to blame most of the time like lightning strikes in drought affected forests Dry lightning was responsible for starting a number of fires in Victoria s East Gippsland region in late December which then traveled more than 20 kilometers 12 4 miles in just five hours according to state agency Victoria Emergency Humans can also be to blame NSW police have charged at least 24 people with deliberately starting bushfires and have taken legal action against 183 people for fire related offenses since November according to a police statement Fire season in Australia is always dangerous the 2009 Black Saturday fires killed 173 people in Victoria making it the deadliest bushfire disaster on record But conditions have been unusually severe this year fanning the flames and making firefighting conditions particularly difficult Australia is experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades the country s Bureau of Meteorology said in December that last spring was the driest on record Meanwhile a heatwave in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature with some places sweltering under temperatures well above 40 degrees Celsius about 113 120 degrees Fahrenheit Strong winds have also made the fires and smoke spread more rapidly and have led to fatalities a 28 year old volunteer firefighter died in NSW in December after his truck rolled over in high winds Photo gallery by The Atlantic Experts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters like fires and floods weather conditions are growing more extreme and for years the fires have been starting earlier in the season and spreading with greater intensity Several high ranking emergency service officials including the former commissioner of the NSW Fire and Rescue Department sent letters to Prime Minister Scott Morrison in 2019 warning of the impact of the climate crisis on Australia In response Morrison emphasized a commitment to reduce carbon emissions but also said he would stick to sensible policies and that there wasn t a single policy whether it be climate or otherwise that can completely protect against the fires Entire towns have been engulfed in flames and residents across several states have lost their homes The heaviest structural damage occurred in NSW the country s most populated state where 1 588 homes have been destroyed and over 650 damaged In total more than 7 3 million hectares 17 9 million acres have been burned across Australia s six states an area larger than the countries of Belgium and Denmark combined The worst affected state is NSW with more than 4 9 million hectares 12 1 million acres burned To put that into perspective the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires burned more than 7 million hectares about 17 5 million acres according to Brazilian officials In California which is known for its deadly wildfires just over 100 000 hectares 247 000 acres burned in 2019 and about 404 680 hectares 1 million acres in 2018 A total of 27 people across Australia have died this fire season including several volunteer firefighters About half a billion animals have been affected by the fires across NSW with millions likely dead and that s a conservative estimate That number of total animals affected could be as high as one billion nationwide according to ecologists from the University of Sydney The figures for NSW include birds reptiles and mammals except bats It also excludes insects and frogs so the real sum is almost certain to be higher the ecologists said Almost a third of koalas in NSW may have been killed in the fires and a third of their habitat has been destroyed said Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley Some species like koalas aren t in any immediate danger of extinction because they are spread out across the country said the university ecologists But others that live in more niche environments with lower populations including certain types of frogs and birds could be wiped out entirely if their habitats are hit by the fires These are pretty good estimates based on previous research on population density but until the fires stop researchers have no way of surveying just how extensive the damage is and exactly how many animals have died State and federal authorities have been working to combat the fire crisis for months Early in January Victoria declared a state of disaster and NSW declared a state of emergency both granting extraordinary powers and additional government resources to battle the fires The state of Queensland also briefly declared a state of emergency in November There are more than 2 000 firefighters working on the ground in NSW alone and more support is on the way the US Canada and New Zealand have sent additional firefighters to help The federal government has also sent in military assistance like army personnel air force aircraft and navy cruisers for firefighting evacuation search and rescue and clean up efforts The Morrison administration has also allocated 3 billion Australian dollars 2 billion in federal aid to help rebuild vital infrastructure like schools and health facilities struck by fire The prime minister earlier said up to 4 200 will go to each of the volunteer firefighters battling blazes for more than 10 days Other relief measures include compensated pay and extra leave for volunteer firefighters Unfortunately Australia is only just entering its summer season Normally temperatures peak in January and February meaning the country could be months away from finding relief The fires are unlikely to end entirely since they are an annually occurring event and may even get worse if recent years are a guide Donations can be made to several organizations working toward victim relief and recovery including the Australian Red Cross Salvation Army Australia the NSW Rural Fire Service and the St Vincent de Paul Society Australia You can also help the devastated animal population by giving to wildlife rescue and treatment groups like WIRES the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital and Currumbin Wildlife Hospital ,-1
Australia is no stranger to wildfires but this season has been unprecedented in scale and intensity and the summer is far from over So far at least 28 people have died in blazes that have swept the country more than 3 000 homes have been destroyed and roughly 7 3 million hectares 17 9 million acres of land has been burnt So what has caused the blazes which have devastated such huge swathes of the country Australia s deadly fires have been fuelled by a combination of extreme heat prolonged drought and strong winds The country is in the grip of a heatwave with record breaking temperatures over the last three months In mid December the nation saw the hottest day in history the average temperature was 41 9 degrees Celsius These conditions which show few signs of abating in the next few weeks have been accompanied by brisk winds which fan the flames and push the smoke across Australia s major cities Authorities say that wind speeds have been recorded at 60 miles per hour All this follows the country s driest spring since records began 120 years ago with much of New South Wales and Queensland experiencing rainfall shortfalls since early 2017 Trees shrubs and grasslands have turned into the perfect tinder for flames Bushfires are a regular feature in Australia s calendar often triggered by natural causes such as lightning strikes and cannot be blamed on climate change or rising greenhouse gas emissions alone But experts say that the changing climate is key to understanding the ferocity of this years blazes hotter drier conditions are making the country s fire season longer and much more dangerous And Australia s climate is definitely changing According to the country s Bureau of Meteorology temperatures have already risen by more than one degrees Celsius since 1920 with much of the increase taking place since 1950 So far the response has been largely reactive aimed at evacuating residents to safety and stopping the blazes from spreading Australia relies on hundreds of thousands of volunteer firefighters who have been working around the clock to try and bring the fires under control for months The armed forces have now also been deployed to fight the fires and evacuate residents and the United States Canada and New Zealand have also sent resources including firefighters to help stem the blazes But in the long term experts have said that there should be a review of building standards in bushfire zones to create resilient homes and larger buffer zones between the bush and properties There have also been calls for emphasis on traditional fire management techniques used by Indigenous communities and a paid fire service less reliant on volunteers The country s government and conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison have been widely denounced for their response to the crisis particularly the insistence that fires are nothing new and climate change is irrelevant At the end of last year the Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said raving inner city lefties were stoking concerns about the climate and that fires had existed in the country since time began And Mr Morrison decided to take a family holiday to Hawaii in December despite the infernos Domestically the government also has a poor record tackling climate for instance the administration repealed a successful carbon tax in 2014 which had contributed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 4 per cent over two years And on the international stage Mr Morrison s delegation to the recent UN summit on climate change were accused of thwarting negotiations to agree on plans to cut carbon emissions globally Australia is also the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas and the coal lobby holds significant sway over national politics But Mr Morrison has denounced calls to downsize Australia s profitable coal industry And despite calls from fire chiefs for an emergency summit on the rising threat of bushfires amid the changing climate the prime minister has also has rejected the need to change his government s approach to climate change Telegraph Media Group Limited 2020 We rely on advertising to help fund our award winning journalism We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future Thank you for your support Need help Visit our adblocking instructions page ,2020-03-13T11:20:02
The brownish orange skies choking soot mass evacuations and deaths of people and wildlife are all familiar to Californians who have endured their share of fire disasters in recent years except that the bushfires raging across more than 15 million acres of Australia are orders of magnitude worse Nearly 140 separate blazes have burned since November springtime in Australia sending plumes of smoke all the way to South America They have burned at least 2 000 structures killed 25 people including three firefighters and incinerated hundreds of millions of animals including kangaroos and native endangered koala bears And they may be a chilling foretaste of how much worse things can get in the fire scarred Golden State which has experienced a series of enormous and deadly fires over the past five years Those fires however burned about 5 3 million acres a third of what is burning Down Under all at once It is among the biggest fire disasters ever seen on Earth generating an unprecedented response from 2 700 firefighters 3 000 Australian army reservists and a contingent of 159 U S Forest Service firefighters including 39 from California What we re watching is how accelerating climate change is transforming the landscape around us and is in turn driving the death of millions of animals and shifting the ecosystems said LeRoy Westerling a climate and fire scientist at UC Merced And it is not a one off This is just one more exclamation point We keep thinking Well it can t get worse than this but it just keeps getting worse The weather conditions and terrain in Australia are strikingly similar to California The country is suffering from a prolonged drought similar to the five year dry spell California endured until 2017 an event that is still impacting land and water use Not only are both places dry in the summer but the dry periods are lasting longer than they used to leaving huge expanses of parched brush chaparral and woodlands vulnerable Michael Mann a climate scientist and professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University said rainfall patterns in Australia are influenced by what is known as the Indian Ocean Dipole much like El Niño events in the Pacific Ocean impact weather on the West Coast The dipole is defined by positive and negative sea surface temperature variations The positive phase is when temperatures are higher than average in the western Indian Ocean which have been linked to droughts in Indonesia and Australia It is a contributor to the current drought Mann said in an email from Australia where he is studying the linkage between climate change and extreme weather and some scientists speculate that the positive dipole events are becoming more frequent and extreme due to climate change Comparisons to California are difficult because Australia is so much larger it is nearly the size of the continental United States and because the wildfires there cover such a huge area The fires have burned up to an estimated 15 6 million acres on the island continent The two worst fire years in the United States over the past decade were 2015 and 2017 when about 10 million acres burned each year The most devastating year in California was 2018 when about 2 million acres burned including the nearly 500 000 acre Mendocino Complex Fire the largest in state history The Australian fires have devoured considerably more land than the 2019 fires in the Amazon rain forest which covered 2 2 million acres and caused worldwide outrage because they appeared to be connected to slash and burn deforestation in Brazil to make way for agriculture and mining Out of control wildfires in Siberia in 2019 covered 6 7 million acres But the fires in Australia are being driven by strong winds just like the catastrophic wildfires in California including the Mendocino Complex and the 2018 Camp Fire which killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise in Butte County Michael Mohler deputy director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said high temperatures low humidity strong winds and dry fuels are the volatile ingredients that have made both places more susceptible to fire than ever before The result has been dangerous fire behavior including destructive fire tornadoes and pyrocumulus clouds which send flames shooting 30 000 feet in the air We are absolutely seeing similar fire behavior in Australia with the same type of explosive fire growth said Mohler who declared Cal Fire ready to send personnel Down Under upon request They have extreme wind events across the country We re seeing fires spot miles ahead similar to the Camp Carr and Tubbs fires Explosive fire twisters and massive fire clouds plagued firefighters during the Carr Fire which burned 359 square miles in Shasta and Trinity counties in 2018 and the 2017 Tubbs Fire which incinerated more than 5 000 homes in Santa Rosa and killed 22 people The conditions in Australia have been at least as extreme A heat wave combined with the driest spring on record has helped the flames grow across six states The average temperature across the country hit a record 107 degrees just before Christmas The hardest hit regions in New South Wales on the east coast and Victoria in the southeast endured high winds and temperatures above 100 degrees through the New Year The western Sydney suburb of Penrith recorded a high of about 118 degrees last weekend according to Australia s Bureau of Meteorology It is by all accounts an ecological disaster The blazes have killed people and wiped out towns but most of what is burning is bushland eucalyptus forests and national park land where the country s unique wildlife resides Ecologists estimate that some 480 million animals have died in New South Wales including almost a third of the beloved koalas Dead kangaroos birds reptiles cattle and other mammals have been found in the blackened bush The smoke cover has drifted across the water to New Zealand and according to some reports South America The hazy orange air has been measured at 11 times the hazardous level in some places including Sydney And Australia is only in the middle of its fire season It is to California firefighters a familiar set of circumstances but on a much larger scale Kim Zagaris the wildfire policy and technology adviser for the Western Fire Chiefs Association said Cal Fire formed a partnership with fire officials in Australia after out of control bushfires in February 2009 killed 173 people and destroyed 2 000 homes in the state of Victoria The wind driven fires dubbed the Black Saturday bushfires prompted an official government inquiry and report and a new category purple on the country s heat maps Since then Australian fire commanders have regularly come to California to share information A large contingent happened to be visiting when the 2017 Wine Country blazes broke out The Australians told Zagaris that the wind driven infernos were eerily similar to Black Saturday We have a very similar wildfire climate with similar droughts and conditions said Zagaris a retired state fire and rescue chief for the Governor s Office of Emergency Services We are all fighting the climate issue We both continue to experience more explosive fire conditions Zagaris who gave a series of talks in Australia in 2018 said firefighting there is a largely volunteer effort in rural areas which is similar to the way things are done here He said a third of the 55 000 firefighters in California are volunteers The difference is that in California close to 40 million people are crammed together in a space only a fraction of the size of Australia which is 18 times larger Many Californians live next to forests and open space known as the wildland urban interface often forcing urban and rural firefighters to join forces The rangeland in Australia doesn t butt up against urban areas as much he said which is probably why Australians are generally expected to stay and defend their own property Cal Fire s Ready Set Go program teaches residents how to prepare their property for wildfires but residents are expected to evacuate and leave the firefighting to the professionals Zagaris said Australians are still expected to protect their own property but firefighters deploy air tankers a relatively new practice there military aircraft and Chinook helicopters to help douse flames Naval ships have also been used to evacuate beach communities surrounded by fire The most populous cities Melbourne and Sydney recently looked into some of the strategies developed in the United States for fighting fire in the wildland urban interface It s not clear whether those techniques are being used in the unfolding disaster but Zagaris said the collaboration will by necessity continue California is like the Disneyland of disasters he said and as much as we ve learned from our disasters there s a lot we can learn from others around the world Peter Fimrite is a San

 We are trying to make sure that every animal has a chance for survival By Zahra Hirji Posted on January 17 2020 at 4 45 p m ET Hastings River mouse As Australia continues to fight its record setting bushfires the scientific community is racing to identify and save the animals in burnt zones that are on the brink of extinction There is no blueprint for how to do this But experts have recognized they ve got to work fast in order to deal with the current crisis facing Australia s wildlife and to prepare for more to come in the face of worsening human caused climate change We ve been caught with our pants down Sarah Legge an ecology professor at Australian National University told BuzzFeed News She s on a newly appointed government panel tasked with helping inform a large scale recovery plan for the many species of plants and animals threatened by the fires I think there was a little bit of shock paralysis over the holiday period said Legge By early January however a consensus had emerged that we ve got to get organized and do something fast The species considered most at risk of extinction right now are the ones that were endangered before the unprecedented bushfire season began last fall battling already low populations on limited parts of the continent By overlaying maps of the burnt areas with the known territories of endangered species experts are working on drafting a preliminary list of highly threatened animals plants and ecosystems The analysis is ongoing but experts said some species likely to end up on the list are the Kangaroo Island dunnart the glossy black cockatoo the Hastings River mouse the eastern bristlebird and the greater glider The ongoing bushfires are an ecological disaster the government panel members wrote in a Jan 15 update While the full extent of the impacts on species and natural assets will not be known until the fires are out and it is safe to access affected areas we know they will be extensive and severe The greater glider The International Union for Conservation of Nature has labeled the Kangaroo Island dunnart located only on Southern Australia s Kangaroo Island as critically endangered There were an estimated fewer than 500 animals before the fires according to the Australian government They are tiny mouselike mammals with gray fur long tails and pointy snouts All sites that we ve seen the dunnart at in the last 30 years have burned effectively its entire range Rosemary Hohnen a postdoctoral fellow at Charles Darwin University studying the species told BuzzFeed News by email Given it was previously considered critically endangered and that it will be very difficult for individuals to survive in burnt areas it s clear the species is in real peril on the very edge of extinction There is concern that surviving Kangaroo Island dunnarts could face food shortage a lack of vegetation cover and risk getting eaten by feral cats If any of the endangered animals are found Hohnen said one option is to put up a fence around them to keep out predators The glossy black cockatoo which the government has designated as vulnerable is a black bird with bright red feathers on its tail that is also found on Kangaroo Island as well as along a stretch of the east coast of Australia Glossy black cockatoo On Kangaroo Island 59 of its feeding habitat has been burnt It s also affected nest trees including 93 artificial nest hollows that were installed by the recovery program Daniella Teixeira a PhD student studying the glossy black cockatoo at the University of Queensland said in an email No birds have been rescued or brought into care as far as I m aware People currently working on helping these birds recover are seeking to replace lost nests with artificial boxes as well as plant thousands of new food trees according to Teixeira Researchers like me are hoping to study how the birds respond to these events so that we can make better decisions about what conservation actions to take now to help the birds in the short term but also give them a better chance at surviving such events again in the future she added And the government led effort is not just looking at species that were previously considered at risk We will also look at species that are not formerly listed as threatened but which may have been so severely impacted by the fire that they now qualify as threatened Legge said It s unknown how long the resulting surveying and recovery efforts could last While the search for endangered animals is underway conservationists and others have launched rescue operations for other animals including kangaroos and koalas whose young offspring are called joeys An injured koala On Kangaroo Island for example Humane Society International workers have been working long days to find animals in need The rescued animals are bundled into the car small joeys are held by team members and larger animals are held in laundry baskets which have proven to be excellent for transporting koalas They are then taken to the emergency vet hospital set up at Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park Kelly Donithan a disaster response expert with Humane Society International told BuzzFeed News in an email In the first week out in the field HSI s team rescued 39 animals 32 koalas 3 kangaroos 1 wallaby 2 possums and 1 echidna The most threatened animal affected by these fires is the Kangaroo Island Dunnart which may have been wiped out by this disaster Donithan said We are trying to make sure that every animal has a chance for survival Update This story has been updated to clarify that the offspring of kangaroos and koalas are known as joeys Zahra Hirji is a science reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington DC Contact Zahra Hirji at zahra hirji

BODALLA Australia AP Crews battling Australia s wildfires said Sunday that they have been able to turn from defense to offense for the first time in weeks thanks to a break in the weather Dale McLean who is helping manage the response to a fire near the town of Bodalla in New South Wales state was part of team that was bulldozing down small trees and burning scrub ahead of the fire s projected path to try to stop it from reaching a major highway by starving it of fuel This fire took a major run about seven or eight days ago and with the weather changing now the weather settling down the fire has settled down he said The fire behavior has changed So we re able to get in front of the fire now get on the offensive Other workers echoed McLean s comments saying cooler temperatures and mild winds have finally offered them a chance to make progress The weather is expected to remain benign for the next week although any deterioration in conditions after that could see the wildfires flare up again While battling the blazes volunteer firefighting veteran Mick Stain found some moth larvae or witchetty grubs and turned them into what s known in Australia as bush tucker by roasting them directly on the fire s burning coals Bit creamy and nutty but they re all right Stain said They re not spew worthy so they re pretty good Meanwhile U S tennis star Serena Williams donated her 43 000 winner s check from New Zealand s ASB Classic to the fundraising appeal for victims of the wildfires joining many other tennis stars to pledge money including Ash Barty Nick Kygrios Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova Also on Sunday news came that another firefighter had been killed Bill Slade one of the few professionals among mainly volunteer brigades battling blazes across southeast Australia died after being hit by a falling tree on Saturday near Omeo in eastern Victoria state Forest Fire Management Victoria Executive Director Chris Hardman said The 60 year old married father of two was commended in November for 40 years of service with the forestry agency Although we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees sometimes these tree failures can t be predicted Hardman said Working on the fire ground in a forest environment is a dynamic high risk environment and it carries with it significant risk The tragedy brings the death toll to at least 27 in a crisis that has destroyed more than 2 000 homes and scorched an area larger than the U S state of Indiana since September Four of the casualties have been firefighters The crisis has brought accusations that Prime Minister Scott Morrison s conservative government needs to take more action to counter climate change which experts say has worsened the blazes Thousands of protesters rallied Friday in Sydney and Melbourne calling for Morrison to be fired and for Australia to take tougher action on global warming The prime minister said Sunday that his government was building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change He said the government was developing a national disaster risk reduction framework within the Department of Home Affairs that will deal with wildfires cyclones floods and drought This is a longer term risk framework model which deals with one of the big issues in response to the climate changing Morrison said He said his government accepted that climate change was leading to longer hotter and drier summers despite junior government lawmaker George Christensen posting on social media over the weekend that the cause of the latest fires was arson rather than man made climate change Another junior lawmaker Craig Kelly has also publicly denied any link between climate change and fire crisis State authorities have said a minority of fires are deliberately lit The government s policy is set by the Cabinet Our party room has a broad range of views Morrison said of those within government ranks who reject mainstream climate science Morrison also announced that 76 million Australian dollars 52 million would be spent on providing psychological counseling for firefighters and fire affected communities as part of a previously announced AU 2 billion 1 4 billion recovery fund There has been a deep scar in the landscape that has been left right across our country Morrison said But I am also very mindful as is the government of the very real scars that will be there for quite a period of time to come for those who ve been exposed to the trauma of these bushfires While the fire threat is most acute in rural communities wildfire smoke that has choked some of Australia s largest cities is a reminder to many urban Australians of the unfolding disaster ___ Associated Press writer Rod McGuirk in Canberra Australia contributed to this report ,-1
A homeowner inspects the damage done earlier this month by one of Australia s many wildfires By John PickrellNov 20 2019 4 30 PM SYDNEY AUSTRALIA Australia is on fire like never before and this year s bushfire season which typically peaks in January and February has barely begun Driven in part by a severe drought fires have burned 1 65 million hectares in the state of New South Wales more than the state s total in the previous 3 years combined Six people have died and more than 500 homes have been destroyed As Science went to press some 70 uncontrolled fires were burning in adjacent Queensland and South Australia was bracing for potentially catastrophic burns David Bowman a fire ecologist and geographer and director of the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania in Hobart spoke with Science about the crisis The flames have charred even moist ecosystems once thought safe he says And the fires have become white hot politically with Prime Minister Scott Morrison s Liberal government drawing criticism for refusing to acknowledge any link to climate change The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity Q What is unusual about these fires A The geographical scale and intensity it s happening all up and down the country The very early start to the fire season across eastern Australia The scale of housing loss We re seeing recurrent fires in tall wet eucalypt forests which normally only burn very rarely A swamp dried out near Port Macquarie and organic sediments in the ground caught on fire When you drop the water table the soil is so rich in organic matter it will burn We ve seen swamps burning all around Even Australia s fire adapted forest ecosystems are struggling because they are facing increasingly frequent events In Tasmania over the past few years we have seen environments burning that historically see fires very rarely perhaps every 1000 years The increasing tempo spatial scale and frequency of fires could see ecosystems extinguished Q What is the role of climate change A You have to ask Has there ever been a fire event of 1 65 million hectares that s burnt a large area of what is generally considered fire proof vegetation and also occurred simultaneously with fires in other regions of Australia and California What is happening is extraordinary It would be difficult to say there wasn t a climate change dimension We couldn t have imagined the scale of the current event before it happened We would have been told it was hyperbole This is teaching us what can be true under a climate changed world The numbers scale and diversity of the fires is going to reframe our understanding of bushfire in Australia This is a major event which will have huge intellectual and policy legacies Q What policy issues has the crisis raised A The fires are white hot politically The fact that the government has questioned the appropriateness of talking about the linkage to climate has put scientists in a difficult position There has been an unexpected alliance between 24 former state fire and emergency chiefs who are advocating an awareness of increasing bushfire risk linked to climate change They argue the government has ignored their advice because it doesn t want to talk about climate What they are saying is harmonizing with the warnings coming from scientists Q How do the Australian fires relate to fires in other parts of the world A Whilst this was unfolding in Australia there has been a very late fire season in California So we had the long dreaded overlap between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere fire seasons If this becomes a fixture it s going to make sharing firefighting resources between nations much harder The U S has a huge specialized firefighting aviation force Traditionally we were able to bring U S aircraft and personnel to Australia but with fire events happening simultaneously there will be strains on resource sharing Q How big of a problem is the smoke A There is a strong epidemiological association between smoke and respiratory and cardiovascular health A huge fraction of the population along the east coast maybe a third of the total Australian population of 25 million has been exposed to dangerous smoke levels This will be costly to the health and hospital systems and take people s lives Smoke pollution is currently killing far more people than the flames and it s not over yet Q What research questions do the fires raise A These are overwhelming in number The priorities include getting to grip with the human health impacts of the smoke understanding fire severity and ecological harms and understanding why the intensity varied between regions and how much it was related to prevailing weather There will also be more formal government enquiries which will draw on postfire assessments and the work of climate scientists They will be very influential on future fire management practices Q How is research on the fires being funded A How do you prepare and fund research that was unimaginable even a few months ago There is a disconnect between the scale and speed of these events and the availability of funding to study them We are lucky in that we have some existing projects and databases I would expect a large cross section of scientists from Australia will be entangled in the research in one way or another Thankfully the New South Wales government established a Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub of which I lead the pyrogeographic node The hub was refunded 18 months ago and is led by Ross Bradstock of the University of Wollongong Our databases on fire across New South Wales will enable us to figure out what actually burnt how severely the linkage to vegetation type fuel management other human land uses and climate and weather factors We will look at impacts capturing available satellite imagery and trying to capture operational data such as from infrared scanners on aircraft which can map the fire front and perimeter This will take some time Such pyrogeographic case studies are novel in the literature and yet are critical in understanding what happened and why Q You call yourself a pyrogeographer What is that A Pyrogeography is thinking about landscape people and fire It takes in fire science but also the humanities law psychology epidemiology meteorology and disaster management Fire is part natural disaster and part human caused and modified so I try to keep the door open to discourse from different disciplines It s wonderful that modern research practice can be so transdisciplinary It s great to take people s insights on detailed specialties and bring them to bear on these fire issues There are very few centers globally that can take this approach but there s increasing interest because of the applied nature of the fire disaster problem and the need to understand the intersection of all these different perspectives doi 10 1126 science aba2950 By Jon CohenMar 9 2020 By Rodrigo Pérez

A Pulitzer Prize winning non profit non partisan news organization dedicated to covering climate change energy and the environment A new study found that global warming increased the likelihood for the Australia wildfires to occur by drying out the land Credit Sam Mooy Getty Images Global warming played a big role in generating long lasting heat waves that fueled Australia s deadly 2019 2020 wildfire season a new study by an international team of scientists has concluded Human caused warming increased the chances by at least 30 percent for the extreme fire weather that dried out soil grass brush and trees the research found The heat buildup caused by greenhouse gases probably played an even bigger role than the researchers were able to demonstrate said University of Oxford climate scientist Friederike Otto one of the authors of the new study released Wednesday We found that it was at least 30 percent but it s likely much higher because the models underestimate extreme heat trends one of the very important parts of the equation Otto said Sign up for InsideClimate News Weekly Our stories Your inbox Every weekend Please subscribe me to the following mailing lists Clean Economy Wire Today s Climate ICN Articles Weekly Newsletter I agree to InsideClimate News Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Our stories Your inbox Every weekend In context with World Weather Attribution s other recent studies the big takeaway for Otto is the renewed finding of how global warming is driving heat waves which contribute to other extremes like droughts and fires That is a real game changer in most parts of the world and it s quite different from most other impacts she said Climate change makes the weather completely different We need to get better at predicting heat waves so we can prepare better Many parts of the world don t even record heat waves so there is a lack of awareness that these events are happening A 2017 study showed that heat waves are approaching deadly thresholds for millions of people including thousands in U S cities The extremes have continued in the last few months with Eurasia baking in a record warm winter and the average winter temperature in Moscow surging to above 0 degrees Celsius 32 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time since record keeping began more than 200 years ago There were record highs on the Antarctic Peninsula and a record dry and warm February across large parts of California World Weather Attribution includes scientists from Holland France Australia the U K and the U S as well as experts with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre The study has been submitted for peer review by other scientists Identifying the global warming fingerprint on extreme storms heatwaves cold spells and droughts helps communities prepare the scientists said The fires rekindled public debate about Australia s climate and energy policies with some media and politicians denying the role of fossil fuel emissions in the growing global climate crisis and downplaying the seriousness of the fires The new report shows scientifically that global warming has already increased the wildfire risks to communities in Australia Wildfires burned in Australia from November 2019 through February 2020 across about 73 000 square miles an area nearly as big as Nebraska killing at least 34 people and an estimated 1 5 billion animals The fires some sparked by lightning others by arson also sent choking smoke wafting across major cities in eastern Australia for weeks on end Some of the smoke even reached parts of Antarctica and darkened the snow and ice on New Zealand glaciers The fires also spewed about 900 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere about double Australia s annual fossil fuel emissions other scientists estimated Credit NASA Australian climate scientist Sophie Lewis another of the study s authors said the fires disrupted the daily lives of millions of people I live in southeastern Australia We spent weeks inside our home to try and avoid the hazardous smoke she said Events prior to the current summer were extreme with new records set for high wildfire danger and the bushfire season started months early These are unprecedented events with huge costs That s why it s important to explore them from a scientific standpoint Thousands of people in southeastern Australia were evacuated and about 83 percent of a national park in the region was burned The summer of 2019 2020 ended up as the second warmest on record in Australia ranking just behind the previous summer she added In the new study the scientists analyzed weekly monthly and seasonal fire weather measurements across the areas that burned most intensely between the Great Dividing Range and the sea in New South Wales and Victoria The findings include a sharp increase in the risk of fire weather since 1979 More long term the overall probability for dangerous fire conditions has increased more than four times since 1900 The chances of high fire danger in any one month have increased ninefold the study found and if the average global temperature increase reaches 2 degrees Celsius 3 6 degrees Fahrenheit fire weather like this past summer would be at least four times more likely compared to 1900 The researchers also found that Global warming has increased the warmth of heat waves by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius 1 8 to 3 6 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900 A heatwave of this intensity is at least 10 times more likely now than it would have been around 1900 The observed trend of extreme weather is outpacing the trends predicted by climate models There is no attributable trend in Australia toward extremes of dry weather like the ones observed in 2019 The extreme fire weather conditions of 2019 2020 were intensified by record setting shifts in regional weather patterns There is evidence that human caused climate change is also increasing the fire risk in ways that the attribution study didn t capture said Nerilie Abram a climate extremes researcher with Australian National University and the Australian Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes Research suggests that global warming is intensifying the Indian Ocean Dipole an oscillation in sea surface temperatures similar to the Pacific s El Niño which increases fire risk in southeastern Australia Human caused warming is also shifting winter rainstorm tracks away from southwest and southeast Australia said Abram who was not involved in the new study A clear cool season drying trend has been evident in southwest Australia since the 1970s she said She said the study could have been more complete with additional input from Australian experts who understand important regional climate and fire processes including long term drought which is preconditioning the forests here to burn The Australian wildfires fit a pattern of rising risks around the world said Maarten van Aalst with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in The Hague Climate models project a relatively gradual increase in heat but extremes are increasing much faster said van Aalst who was also part of the World Weather Attribution group that studied the links between global warming and the Australian fires What is happening with that heat is really a challenge around the world he said It s a warning sign that we re reaching the limits of what we can cope with Credit Australian Bureau of Meteorology Just in the last year van Aalst said extreme heat waves around the world probably killed thousands of people deaths that are only now showing up in annual morbidity statistics And the fires in Australia stretched emergency services to their limits with stress on fire brigades that were deployed for 100 days he said The new study will help plan for a future that holds more extremes because of global warming said Cam Walker a volunteer firefighter and Friends of the Earth conservation activist in Australia Those of us on the frontlines are facing changed conditions especially longer and more intense fire seasons and we know that fire fighting strategies need to evolve However it is hard to cut through the opinionated noise that crowds out sensible discussion in the public realm Walker said adding that after the fires conservative media outlets and climate deniers blamed them on a lack of preventive measures Penn State climate researcher Michael Mann who was on sabbatical in Australia during the fires said that Australian scientists explicitly warned about the growing wildfire danger as early as 2008 in a climate report They concluded that the bushfire season would start earlier end slightly later and generally be more intense and that this effect increases over time but should be directly observable by 2020 he said Mann said one of the most important points of the new study is the renewed finding that current heat extremes are far beyond what models have projected A similar study last summer on the summer heatwave in Europe reached a similar conclusion and also found that European heat extremes would have been all but impossible without global warming University of New Mexico climate and fire researcher Matthew Hurteau said the study aligns with similar research in the West showing that human caused climate change is responsible for about half of the area burned since the mid 1980s As the temperature goes up the fuels dry out because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water than a cooler atmosphere he said The western U S can expect increasing areas burned with additional warming By

In Conversation The devastating wildfires rampaging through Australia since September have burned an estimated 25 5 million acres according to news reports Ecologists say the loss of life and habitat have been especially severe for indigenous species of animals and plants An estimated 1 billion animals have died in the fires Walter Jetz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and co director of the Max Planck Yale Center for Biodiversity Movement and Global Change spoke with us about the ongoing ecological disaster in Australia What is the potential for species diversity loss due to the fires Scientists agree that the local population losses will be immense and probably on a scale unmatched by any single event in the past hundred years and beyond While some of the species may eventually rebound and recolonize areas that are impacted now the most troublesome news may not be the local extinctions but rather the potential global extinctions The affected regions in Australia are home to many species that do not occur anywhere else in the world Leaked government reports suggest that for over half a dozen well studied species such as birds frogs and fish over 50 of the global population and in some cases 100 of their habitat may be lost Do we know much yet about what this will mean for the animals and plant species that survive the devastation They will be faced with dramatically reduced habitats and lack of food A large maybe the greatest portion of the losses will not be from the fires directly but from the altered ecological conditions following the disastrous burns When there is an environmental catastrophe of this scale how do researchers assess the impact for native species The most critical input is baseline knowledge on the spatial distribution of populations This is the sort of information that in Australia has been extensively collected through agency driven and research driven monitoring We have no idea how many species of invertebrates or plants may have already been wiped out forever by these fires In other parts of the world efforts such as the Yale based Map of Life aim to help provide this sort of information at increasingly high resolution But even in the well studied Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales data gaps impede a thorough assessment especially for smaller species We have no idea how many species of invertebrates or plants may have already been wiped out forever by these fires What information and resources will policymakers and conservationists in Australia need in order to make decisions once the fires are out New survey campaigns supported by aerial and satellite based remote sensing should help in assessing the recovery of habitats and species Hopefully vital lessons will be learned about the importance of forward looking research and monitoring to support a stronger evidence base for pre and post disaster management Are there efforts underway by the international academic community to help with this My Australian colleagues are shell shocked by the ongoing devastation and are trying to do their best in using past surveys and research to answer the most urgent questions about population losses The Australian research community has pioneered and continues to lead some of the key scientific assessment approaches for spatial biodiversity At the moment I am not aware of organized international efforts but I expect collaborations to form quickly to both add capacity to the work in Australia and to take larger lessons for societally relevant biodiversity research in a world in which such disasters will occur with greater and greater frequency Related Environment Media Contact Fred Mamoun fred mamoun yale edu 203 436 2643 In Conversation In Conversation Managed by the Office of Public Affairs Communications Copyright 2020 Yale University All rights reserved Privacy policy Accessibility at Yale ,-1
 The country put a new visa rule in place to extend their stays Australia has extended its working holiday visa rule from six months to 12 months for visitors who want to help with bushfire relief efforts The change in the Working Holiday Maker program will allow backpackers to assist in the work necessary for recovery including demolition land clearing and repairing dams roads and railways Working holiday visas can also be extended for a second year using the working days accumulated from recovery efforts Acting Minister for Immigration Citizenship Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs Alan Tudge described the initiative as locally driven but assured it will be a massive effort that is effective immediately These hard working Australians have been hit by the recent bushfires but from today they can employ backpackers for six months longer helping them at a critical time in the recovery effort he said We want businesses and charitable organizations to have as many boots on the ground as they need Those who participate in the program are also required to have a high school degree have health insurance for while they re in Australia and be able to prove they can financially support themselves for the first part of their stay down under Anyone from the United States looking to participate must be between 18 to 30 and have a valid passport according to the Australian Visa Bureau This year s bushfire season in Australia was the worst on record The fires are estimated to have killed at least 33 people and perhaps a billion animals More than 3 000 homes were destroyed and an area the size of England was charred If you aren t able to travel to Australia for a year to help rebuild check out other ways of assisting recovery efforts ,-1

Wildfires release vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and may slow the Earth s ability to absorb more CO2 But their impact on climate change is even more complicated By Laurie Clarke The aftermath of bushfire in the township of Rainbow Flat on the Mid North Coast of NSW November 9 2019 Australia s wildfires are burning with such intensity that they re sparking contained small scale weather systems Thunderstorms triggered by atmospheric disturbance might at first seem to offer relief in the form of raindrops but instead bolts of lightning can strike nearby trees and spread the fire even further than before This is a small scale example of an environmental feedback loop where conditions on the ground trigger a self perpetuating chain of events Wildfires pump vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere heating up the planet in the short term But are wildfires helping to accelerate climate change or just a deadly consequence of a more extreme climate Since September hundreds of fires across Australia have engulfed more than 6 3 million hectares of land Villages have been razed and 25 people killed so far Months of hot dry weather and strong winds created the perfectly deadly conditions that keep conflagrations roaring There were at least twice as many fires in New South Wales in 2019 as there were in any other year this century There are a couple of ways increasingly severe wildfire seasons could speed up global climate change In the months immediately following wildfires the volume of CO2 in the world s atmosphere increases magnifying the heat trapped there Wildfires create a substantial contribution because they happen in places like the Amazon rainforest and the peat bogs in Indonesia which contain a lot of carbon says Colin Prentice director of the Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires at Imperial College London The ongoing Australian fire season has released more than 350 million metric tons of CO2 so far with fires expected to keep burning over the next two months By Alex Davies Fires also throw up clouds of soot into the atmosphere which compounds the problem Black carbon is the most strongly light absorbing material from fires and is regarded as one of the most important individual climate warming agents Yafang Cheng a researcher from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz Germany told WIRED in November 2018 These particles can float up into the upper layers of the atmosphere where they exert an even greater heating effect and hang around for months But there are longer term effects too In more typical wildfire cycles the vegetation that burns is usually replaced by the same type of plant life But longer and more severe fire seasons as we re seeing in many parts of the world means it s becoming more difficult to predict what type of vegetation will spring up in the place of the freshly incinerated ecosystems If the frequency and intensity of fires begins to change then you re probably going to change the character of the vegetation as well towards one that is adapted to more frequent fires says Prentice Environment What type of vegetation might grow back after the Australian wildfires is still uncertain But there s a chance that the form it takes could increase the likelihood of future infernos A 2017 study published in the journal Global Change Biology that examined fauna in the Australian Alps found that one of the first plant species to grow back in the area after wildfires was woody shrubs Worryingly these were more flammable than the feathery tussock grasses that had previously colonised the land One caveat to consider though is that in the years following an extreme fire there will simply be less vegetation to burn the next time around meaning a future blaze would be less intense None of this bodes well for the future But there are other factors at play too In short it s not as simple as more fires cause more fire danger says Park Williams assistant research professor at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University By Sabrina Weiss It s not really a dominant mechanism Prentice says of the fire climate change feedback loop It s a mechanism that does exist and we can quantify it in the sense that if there are a lot of fires globally in a particular year that does mean the total biomass on land has gone down a bit and some of that carbon is going to stay in the atmosphere But it s probably fair to say it s a secondary effect The most important effect being of course that we emit millions of metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year and half of it remains there Although less plant life means less photosynthesis and therefore less CO2 being converted to oxygen in the short term vegetation eventually grows back More important than one big fire year is the question what is going to happen to the biomass of plants on the continents in the future warmer world says Williams While we generally focus on the negative effects of climate change one positive is that the rate of plant growth has actually sped up along with accelerating global temperatures Satellite imagery shows that global plant productivity and biomass has increased over the past several decades due to longer growing seasons in cold places more agricultural productivity and increasing CO2 which is after all one of the fundamental fuels for plant growth Right now global plant life handily gobbles up between 25 and 30 per cent of the world s annual CO2 emissions But in time warming and increased CO2 output might put a dent in this oxygen gifting process We don t know what will happen and that s partly because of fire says Williams Fire adds an element of unpredictability the possible effect on global ecosystems are hard to calculate right now Wildfires particularly these kind of fires are what is termed a wicked problem says Claire Belcher professor and chair in wildland fire at the University of Exeter There is no single cause and no single solution and they require a shift in our thought patterns Climate change is a large forcing factor in regards to these fires but it is not the only cause and facing it is not the only solution By Jonn Elledge And although the number of wildfires has increased in recent decades historically some human activities have helped curtail the concentration of blazes By creating cropland and having fairly intense grazing that removes all the biomass you are also removing the fuel says Prentice No one is going to suggest large scale deforestation as a potential solution to wildfires any time soon But on the other hand indiscriminate reforestation could also pose a problem Many governments are keen on the idea of resolving climate change by planting trees but you know trees can burn says Prentice As well as a wicked problem wildfires are also fiendishly difficult to predict We know that global warming increases the likelihood of fires but we need more

The forest fires in Australia have been extinguished and citizens across the country are trying to go back to normal but the disaster and its consequences for wildlife are far from over Many animals have been severely affected such as koalas which are even facing the possibility of extinction according to a report The Fund for Animal Welfare IFAW a wildlife conservation organization said that at least 5 000 koalas have died because of the wildfires That s about 12 of the population of koalas in the New South Wales area which the NGO said it s an intentionally low calculation The real figures are probably much worse Koalas are particularly vulnerable to bushfires as they are slow moving and live in eucalyptus trees that burn quickly and intensely campaigner Josey Sharrad told CNN When fires sweep through their homes they often don t have time to escape particularly in intense crown fires that rage through the treetops where they live Last year the Australian Koala Foundation said koalas may be functionally extinct meaning that the current generation of adults is insufficient to produce a new functional generation This was questioned by experts across the board but the questions about the koalas fate remain standing New South Wales was the area most affected by the forest fires with over 12 million acres of land burned out of the 45 million nationwide This has essentially left koalas without a suitable habitat to live in with the NGO suggesting to list the animals as an endangered species The red list of endangered species managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN has kept the koala in the category of vulnerable since 2014 but the impact of the fires can justify to move it to the immediately superior category of endangered Placing the koalas on that category would help them recover from the devastating blow from the forest fires according to IFAW s report At the same time it would mean stronger penalties for any offenses that could harm them Our koalas only stand a chance if we help Sharrad said But the forest fires weren t the first threat for koalas They are highly vulnerable to climate change food degradation droughts and deforestation which have led to losing almost two thirds of its population over the last three generations according to a 2016 study This rapid destruction of koala habitat combined with climate change is inflicting substantial stress and pushing the species towards extinction Sharrad said Reduction and fragmentation of koala habitat expose koalas to the added threats of vehicle strikes dog attacks stress and disease she added A team from the University of Newcastle Australia led by Ryan Witt has pointed out the need to launch a program to freeze koalas genetic material The conservation of tissues and germ cells of koalas from various areas of the country would facilitate to study their diseases and carry out captive assisted reproduction initiatives if needed If the loss of the koala population continues at the pace set by the latest fires and climate models indicate that it will be this way or even worse a significant genetic diversity could be lost the researchers argued in an article in The Conversation The problem is not only that the fires caused a significant loss of the number of koalas but also that the surviving populations will be more fragmented and isolated with the danger of greater of the proliferation of hereditary diseases Witt s team said Fermin Koop is a reporter from Buenos Aires Argentina He holds an MSc from Reading University UK on Environment and Development and is specialized in environment and climate change news Europe is also struggling with the Covid 19 outbreak 2007 2019 ZME Science Not exactly rocket science All Rights Reserved 2007 2019 ZME Science Not exactly rocket science All Rights Reserved ,-1

more intense after about 2020 By Alice Klein New York Times Redux Eyevine OUTSIDE Batlow in New South Wales the scorched remains of wildlife and livestock lie pressed against fences where they tried in vain to escape the flames that ripped through the area on 4 January Along with the other billion or so other animals that have already perished in Australia s worst wildfires on record they will be buried in mass graves dug by the army Australians myself included are in a state of shock At least 24 people have died more than 2000 homes have been gutted and 8 million hectares an area the size of Scotland have burned For months now the brown and red skies and smell of smoke have been a constant reminder of the tragedy unfolding around us The fires are being driven by record breaking hot dry conditions which make vegetation more likely to catch fire when exposed to ignition sources like lightning strikes or discarded cigarettes On 8 January the Bureau of Meteorology announced that 2019

ravings of some pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies But Sarah Perkins Kirkpatrick at the University of New South Wales says there is no doubt that climate change is a driving factor We can certainly say it has contributed to the length and severity of this fire season she says In 2008 a report commissioned by the Australian government predicted that from about 2020 global warming would cause Australia s fire seasons to start earlier end later and be more intense We knew this was going to happen says Perkins Kirkpatrick We can certainly say climate change is a driving factor We knew this was going to happen Two large scale climate phenomena are also contributing to the conditions underpinning the fires says Andrew Watkins at Australia s Bureau of Meteorology The Indian Ocean Dipole IOD has pushed warm water away from Australia towards Africa leading to drought And the Southern Annular Mode SAM has driven hot dry winds from Australia s desert interior towards its east coast and fanned fires in New South Wales and Victoria the south eastern states that have been worst hit These two phenomena have coincided in Australia in the past but never for this long in recorded history says Watkins Add in the extra 1 C of warming that Australia has experienced since 1910 and you get a dangerous mix he says The fires started in September a month earlier than Australia s official fire danger season which runs from October until the end of March They have already burned through a greater area than the 2018 California wildfires and the 2019 Amazon fires combined and torn through rainforests in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland that have historically been too wet to burn The sheer intensity of the fires has caused them to generate their own storm clouds called pyrocumulonimbus which can spit out lightning that starts more fires Former New South Wales fire and rescue commissioner Greg Mullins wrote in November that he had rarely seen fire generated thunderstorms in his 47 years of fighting fires but now they are occurring regularly It is also now common to see my fellow Sydneysiders wearing gas masks on the way to work On 1 January Canberra s air quality was the worst of any major city in the world The fires have taken a huge toll on Australia s unique wildlife Chris Dickman at the University of Sydney estimates that 1 3 billion mammals birds and reptiles have died in the fires Flying animals like birds and bats and fast moving animals like kangaroos may initially have been able to escape the flames but probably died soon afterwards because of the difficulty of finding food water and shelter in the blackened landscape says Dickman We also know that invasive species like cats and foxes quickly move in after a fire goes through and pick off small native animals so it s really grim he says Dickman has particularly grave fears for species like the eastern bristlebird long footed potoroo and silver headed antechinus which are already endangered and live almost exclusively in fire affected areas They may have been wiped out altogether he says Australia s prime minister Scott Morrison has been heavily criticised for ignoring a meeting request from 23 former fire and emergency service leaders early last year They wanted to warn him of the risk of a catastrophic looming fire season Morrison has also refused to ramp up Australia s greenhouse emissions reduction targets saying in a press conference on 2 January that the government needs to balance a vibrant and viable economy with a vibrant and sustainable environment According to 2019 figures 93 per cent of Australia s energy comes from fossil fuels compared with the 80 per cent average for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development Without a big shift to renewable energy the country is on track to miss its 2030 Paris climate deal target As New Scientist went to press dozens of fires continued to burn in New South Wales and Victoria but light rain and cooler conditions since 5 January had helped firefighters partially contain them None were burning at emergency levels but there were concerns that forecast warmer weather could soon cause conditions to deteriorate again Typically in southern Australia the hottest weeks are at the end of January and in early February so we haven t even hit our hottest period yet says Watkins Shifts in the IOD and SAM climate patterns suggest that the hot dry conditions should ease by March or April says Watkins We don t know when they will return but modelling suggests that climate change will make such IOD events more common he says When the fires are finally extinguished it will be a long road to recovery For many Australians it is clear that these fires aren t business as usual For me that realisation came as ash rained down on the face of my infant son at a Sydney beach On social media on the radio at the pub people are finally talking about what we need to do about climate change If that pressures the government into real action it will be one small consolation More on these topics Magazine issue 3264 published 11 January 2020 Previous article

CNET también está disponible en español Don t show this again Bushfires have been ravaging the country for months devastating towns rural communities and livelihoods Here are the best ways to help Australia is on fire Australia is facing an unprecedented national crisis as bushfires tear through rural communities across the nation Since September at least 25 people have died and more than 2 000 homes have been destroyed The scale of the threat is immense and fires continue to burn with authorities calling for people to evacuate their homes Eerily the bushfire season has just begun and Australia is bracing for continuous weeks of catastrophic danger Australians caught up in the crisis are taking to social media and pleading for help Entire towns have been flattened as fires snaked through bushland across highways and up mountains In New South Wales and Victoria the most populous states in the country people tried to outrun the blaze and highways were clogged with cars South Australia s Kangaroo Island experienced some of the worst conditions in early January with a third of the island ablaze The Army reserves were called in to help the relief effort across the nation while major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne continue to be covered in a dense smoke that has not lifted for months Some regions of the country recorded air quality measurements 20 times above the hazardous level The situation remains dire Australians are exhausted and frustrated by a lack of clear leadership With the fire season still in its earliest days and conditions continuing to fluctuate between poor and manageable help is required Here s what we know about the ongoing fires and how you can help from Australia or afar This is a complex question Australia is a continent familiar with bushfires bushfire management and the importance of fires in regenerating the land The indigenous people who have lived across the island continent for tens of thousands of years have long known the importance of fire management and how it contributes to the health of ecosystems Bushfires are a well understood threat but the fires now burning across the nation have been described as unprecedented in their ferocity and scale Fires can start in a number of ways from carelessly discarded cigarettes to lightning strikes and arson but they re fueled by a dizzying amount of factors A lack of rain and low soil moisture can help enable small fires to grow in size and coupled with the high temperatures and fierce winds that Australia has experienced in the last few months these small fires can become huge infernos In addition with the fire season getting longer the window to perform critical hazard reduction burns has decreased giving fires a chance to really take hold The bushfire risk for the 2019 season was well known to Australian firefighting chiefs who had been trying to meet with Scott Morrison the Australian prime minister since April worried that a crisis was coming but they were constantly rebuffed A greenhouse gas cannot start a fire on its own Bushfires aren t started by climate change but they are exacerbated by the effects of global warming The Climate Council an independent community funded climate organization suggests bushfire conditions are now more dangerous than they were in the past with longer bushfire seasons drought drier fuels and soils and record breaking heat The link between bushfires and climate change has become a political football but experts agree climate change explains the unprecedented nature of the current crisis Notably Australia experienced its hottest year on record in 2019 climbing 1 5 degrees Celsius higher than the average according to a report by the Bureau of Meteorology Rising temperatures increase the risk of bushfire and in November Sydney experienced a catastrophic fire danger for the first time ever There is also a horrifying feedback loop that occurs when great swaths of land are ablaze a fact the globe grappled with during the Amazon fires of 2019 Bushfires release carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere The gas which makes up only a small percentage of the total gases in the atmosphere is exceptionally good at trapping heat In just three months Australia s fires are estimated to have released 350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide Experts warn a century or more will be needed to absorb the carbon dioxide released Fires are raging in every state with some of the greatest conflagrations in NSW and Victoria The Gospers Mountains fires in NSW have burned over half a million hectares and scientists suggest it could be the largest single ignition point fire in Australia s history The total area that s been burned is rapidly approaching 8 million hectares almost 20 million acres That s almost ten times the amount of burnt area the Amazon experienced in 2019 and about three times the amount burnt in California s 2018 wildfires The Japanese weather satellite Himawari captured some stunning images from space of the smoke plumes developing off the south east coast of Australia You can see the formation of huge pyrocumulus clouds a type of smoke cloud often seen during bushfires that can generate its own problematic weather including lightning storms Impressive Himawari rapid scan animation showing smoke from the NSW VIC fires heading east into the Tasman Sea The images are 2 5 minutes apart capturing more detail Notice the afternoon thunderstorms over NSW Read about Himawari satellite at https t co sTvIw7xdKl pic twitter com swU1dlYl4e The Guardian Australia has an excellent interactive map you can use to understand the extreme size of the fires and the entire fire front compared to other cities around the globe The dust and ash from the fires have spread across the ocean and as far as New Zealand s Franz Josef Glacier On Jan 1 images emerged of Franz Josef s snowy mountaintops colored a caramel brown The distance between the glacier and the bushfire front is about the same as the distance from Boston to Miami This glacier is in New Zealand approx 2000km away from Sydney Unreal https t co aPkOBHvoNh The majority of these fires are burning in regional and rural areas where volunteer firefighting services are the chief firefighting organizations The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has around 70 000 members but most of them are performing unpaid work to protect the lives and homes of their compatriots A report by the BBC suggests approximately 3 000 firefighters are on the ground every day battling blazes American and Canadian firefighters and fire experts have been flown in over the past month to help control the blazes Over 100 US firefighters have been flown in with more flying out on Jan 6 Thank you to our mates flying out Monday to join more than 100 brave US firefighters helping battle the devastating Australian bushfires We are grateful all you are doing alongside our firies volunteers for the many messages of support from friends across the US https t co sRvVxu6ODD On Jan 4 Morrison announced the Australian government would be sending in military support including the country s largest warship HMAS Adelaide to help evacuate regional communities on Victoria s coast Additionally 3 000 army reservists were asked to assist in fire recovery efforts Four extra water bombers have been leased to provide additional air support Another complex question Predictions suggest they will stretch well into 2020 After all Australia is only one month through summer and dry hot conditions persist through March and April Much needed rain which would help alleviate some of the uncontrolled blazes is still forecast to be months away An erroneous report in November 2019 stated that the koala an Australian icon was functionally extinct due to the bushfires burning across NSW and Queensland Experts do not believe this to be true but the species and many other native Australian fauna are under threat as a direct result of the uncontrolled blazes An ecologist at the University of Sydney estimates that up to 480 million animals may have perished or will die in the conflagrations including up to 8 000 koalas based on a methodology used to estimate how many animals live within the fire zone Sussan Ley Australia s environment minister told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the true extent of deaths can t be fully grasped until the fires have stopped burning and a proper assessment can be made As the fires slither across the nation it s not only the koala that is in strife much of Australia s native wildlife is being displaced Zoos Victoria has provided a handy guide on how to help As the Victorian bushfire crisis continues here is how you can provide immediate assistance to

firefighters some reprieve but there is some concern that Jan 9 and Jan 10 could bring worse conditions once again In South Australia where fires burnt through swaths of land on Kangaroo Island there is a total fire ban for Jan 7 Fire activity may increase over the course of the day A report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation explains how wildlife experts are worried about the fate of many of the island s threatened species A real sense of frustration has been building from the Australian public toward the governing conservative Liberal party and the prime minister Scott Morrison As the bushfire crisis began to crescendo the first time Morrison was holidaying in Hawaii but amid public backlash and following the deaths of two volunteer firefighters cut his trip short by a day There have been allegations within the Australian press and across social media that somehow the Greens a center left party are somehow to blame for the extent of the fires because they prevented hazard

unprecedented bushfires engulfing parts of the country causing thousands to flee the southeastern coast under blood red skies But the fires have been blazing around Australia since September killing at least 24 people and gutting an area larger than Denmark Over 2 000 homes have been destroyed and conditions are expected to worsen this weekend with months left to go in a fire season that seems to get longer every year Our reporters have been on the ground capturing the crisis as it unfolded whether speaking with evacuees or analyzing why it happened and telling readers how to help The New York Times Armageddon Is Here Australian Readers Share Their Wildfire Experiences Residents and tourists in Australia have been left reeling as wildfires engulf parts of the country killing at least 24 people and destroying an area larger than Denmark We asked readers to describe how they have grappled with one of the worst fire seasons on record We heard from people who said they fled to the beach where they dug trenches and prepared to jump into the water at a moment s notice Some said they sought refuge in camps where people brought dogs chickens goats and other animals Others said they stayed behind hosing down their homes in the hopes of saving their property from destruction We received more than a hundred responses from around the country Many described struggling to breathe amid the choking smoke and being overcome with sadness and anger as they watched their communities and forests burn and pondered the toll it had on the country s renowned wildlife BBC News Australia fires A visual guide to the bushfire crisis Rain has brought some respite to the thousands of firefighters and volunteers tackling the blazes which have been burning since September The fires intensified over the past week with a number towns evacuated At least 24 people have so far been killed including three volunteer firefighters and more than 6 3 million hectares 63 000 sq km or 15 6 million acres of bush forest and parks have been burned In the worst hit state New South Wales NSW fire has affected almost five million hectares destroying more than 1 300 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere ABC Australia Why wasn t there more prescribed burning and would it have helped It happened in 2018 when the Queensland farm lobby claimed the new and more restrictive land clearing laws had worsened the state s bush fires And it s happening now with Coalition MPs regularly claiming there s a Greens conspiracy to stop bushfire hazard reduction Late last month the Morrison Government announced an inquiry into the effect of past and current vegetation and land management practices on bushfires In response many environmentalists have argued the inquiry is an opportunistic attempt to use the tragedy of the fires to weaken land clearing laws They also argue that blaming greenies is a distraction from the bigger issue the national policy on climate change On Saturday the Prime Minister pointed the finger saying people who say they are seeking those actions on climate change could also be the same people who don t share the same urgency of dealing with hazard reduction
