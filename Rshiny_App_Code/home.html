    <h2 class="featurette-heading">When were the Australian Wildfires?</h2>
    <p class="lead">Each year Australia has wildfire season which is considered to run from September to March. The seasonality of bushfires varies significantly having a different impact from year to year. This past season, 2019-2020 was particularly bad with 49 million acres burned. The fires started early in June in the southeast of the country with the major fires peaking in December and January.</p>

    <p class="lead">The amount of destruction was far greater than previous years with the past few years averaging about 700 thousand acres burned. The fires destroyed over 5,900 buildings and killed 34 people but the biggest devastation is in the estimated one billion animals that were killed including some endangered species.</p>

      <p class="lead">As the fires grew, news spread around the globe with discussions around climate change and the greater impacts the fires would have on the country. The smoke pollution caused by the fires was 11 times greater than the hazardous level for human health. In the aftermath of the fires, a large outstanding question is still how much of an impact climate change had on these recent events.</p>
